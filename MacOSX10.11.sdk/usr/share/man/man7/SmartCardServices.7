.Sh NAME
.Nm SmartCardServices
.Nd overview of smart card support
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
is a set of components which add native support for smart cards to OS X.
.Pp
Supported smart cards appear as separate keychains.  A Tokend module for each smart card
you wish to use must be installed in
.Pa /Library/Security/tokend
.Sh USB SMART CARD READER DRIVERS
OS X has built-in support for USB CCID class-compliant smart card readers.
For other readers, install the reader driver in
.Pa /usr/local/libexec/SmartCardServices/drivers .
Each driver is a bundle.  The bundle contains an XML file Info.plist which contains
the device's USB vendor ID and product ID.  For detailed description of the plist format
and how to write a reader driver, see http://pcsclite.alioth.debian.org/api/group__IFDHandler.html
.Sh SMART CARD APDU LOGGING
It is possible to turn on logging for smart cards.  Logging is turned on by setting
the global preference:
.Pp
.Li "sudo defaults write /Library/Preferences/com.apple.security.smartcard Logging -bool yes"
.Pp
After a smart card reader is connected (or after reboot) all operations including contents
of sent and received APDU messages are then logged into the system log.  Logging uses the facility
com.apple.security.smartcard.log
so it is possible to set up filtering of these logs into custom targets (see
.Xr asl.conf 5 )
.Pp
To avoid security risks that could occur if logging is turned on indefinitely, the logging setting
is one-shot - it must be turned on by the command above to start logging again with a new reader.
This includes unplugging and replugging the same reader.
