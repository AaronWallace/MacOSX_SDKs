    @class QTCaptureDecompressedVideoOutput

    @abstract An QTCaptureDecompressedVideoOutput object is an output destination for QTCaptureSession that can be used to process decompressed
    frames from the video being captured.

    @discussion This class represents an output destination for a QTCaptureSession object that can be used to process decompressed frames from the
    video being captured. Instances of QTCaptureDecompressedVideoOutput produce decompressed video frames suitable for high-quality processing.
    Because instances maintain maximum frame quality and avoid dropping frames, using this output may result in reduced performance while capturing.
    Applications that need to process decompressed frames but can tolerate dropped frames or drops in decompression quality should use
    QTCaptureVideoPreviewOutput instead. Applications can access the decompressed frames via the
    captureOutput:didOutputVideoFrame:withSampleBuffer:fromConnection: delegate method. Clients can also create subclasses of
    QTCaptureDecompressedVideoOutput to add custom capturing behavior.

    @method pixelBufferAttributes
    @abstract Returns the Core Video pixel buffer attributes previously set by setPixelBufferAttributes: that determine what kind of pixel buffers
    are output by the receiver.
    @discussion This method returns the pixel buffer attributes set by setPixelBufferAttributes: that clients can use to customize the size and pixel
    format of the video frames output by the receiver. When the dictionary is non-nil, the receiver will attempt to output pixel buffers using the
    attributes specified in the dictionary. A non-nil dictionary also guarantees that the output CVImageBuffer is a CVPixelBuffer. When the value for
    kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey is set to an NSNumber, all image buffers output by the receiver will be in that format. When the value is an
    NSArray, image buffers output by the receiver will be in the most optimal format specified in that array. If the captured images are not in the
    one of the specified pixel formats, then a format conversion will be performed. If the dictionary is NIL or there is no value for the
    kCVPixelBufferPixelFormatTypeKey, then the receiver will output images in the most efficient possible format given the input. For example, if the
    source is an iSight producing component Y'CbCr 8-bit 4:2:2 video then Y'CbCr 8-bit 4:2:2 will be used as the output format in order to avoid any
    conversions. The default value for the returned dictionary is nil.
    @result A dictionary containing pixel buffer attributes for buffers output by the reciever. The keys in the dictionary are described in
    CoreVideo/CVPixelBuffer.h. If the return value is nil, then the receiver outputs buffers using the fastest possible pixel buffer attributes.
