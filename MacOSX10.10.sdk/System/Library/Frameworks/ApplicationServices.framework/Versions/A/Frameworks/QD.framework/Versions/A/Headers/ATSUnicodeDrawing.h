 *  ATSUDrawText()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CTFrameDraw, CTLiineDraw, or CTRunDraw instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Draws a specified range of text in a QuickDraw graphics port or
 *    Quartz graphics context.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Before calling ATSUDrawText, you will most likely want to call
 *    ATSUSetLayoutControls to set a value for the kATSUCGContextTag
 *    attribute in order to specify your current graphics context.
 *    Otherwise, ATSUI will attempt to draw using Quickdraw style text
 *    rendering in whatever Quickdraw GrafPort is currently active (use
 *    SetPort to determine the currently active Quickdraw GrafPort, see
 *    Quickdraw.h). Carbon applications can create a CGContext from a
 *    Quickdraw GrafPort using the functions QDBeginCGContext and
 *    QDEndCGContext (see Quickdraw.h). Cocoa applications can call the
 *    method "graphicsPort" on the current NSGraphicsContext in order
 *    to get a CGContextRef to pass into ATSUI (use the method
 *    "currentContext" to obtain the current NSGraphicsContext, see
 *    NSGraphicsContext.h for more information). ATSUDrawText examines
 *    the text layout object to ensure that each of the characters in
 *    the range is assigned to a style run. If there are gaps between
 *    style runs, ATSUI assigns the characters in the gap to the style
 *    run that precedes (in storage order) the gap. If there is no
 *    style run at the beginning of the text range, ATSUI assigns these
 *    characters to the first style run it finds. If there is no style
 *    run at the end of the text range, ATSUI assigns the remaining
 *    characters to the last style run it finds. If you want to draw a
 *    range of text that spans multiple lines, you should call
 *    ATSUDrawText for each line of text to draw, even if all the lines
 *    are in the same text layout object. You should adjust the
 *    iLineOffset parameter to reflect the beginning of each line to be
 *    drawn. Please note that when drawing into a GrafPort, calls to
 *    QDSwapTextFlags have no effect on ATSUI text rendering. The
 *    proper way to achieve Quartz text rendering from ATSUI is to use
 *    the kATSUCGContextTag attribute to specify a CGContextRef in each
 *    ATSUTextLayout before calling ATSUDrawText.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      A layout containing text to draw.
 *    
 *    iLineOffset:
 *      The starting offset of the range of text to draw. To specify
 *      the beginning of the text buffer, pass kATSUFromTextBeginning
 *      for this parameter.
 *    
 *    iLineLength:
 *      The length of the range of text to draw. To specify a range
 *      that continues to the end of the text buffer, pass
 *      kATSUToTextEnd for this parameter.
 *    
 *    iLocationX:
 *      The x-coordinate of the origin (in either the current graphics
 *      port or Quartz graphics context) of the line containing the
 *      text range to render. Note that the ATSUTextMeasurement type is
 *      defined as a Fixed value, so you must ensure that your
 *      coordinates are converted to Fixed values before passing them
 *      to this function (see FixMath.h for conversion functions). Pass
 *      the constant kATSUUseGrafPortPenLoc to draw relative to the
 *      current pen location in the current graphics port.
 *    
 *    iLocationY:
 *      The y-coordinate of the origin (in either the current graphics
 *      port or Quartz graphics context) of the line containing the
 *      text range to render. Note that the ATSUTextMeasurement type is
 *      defined as a Fixed value, so you must ensure that your
 *      coordinates are converted to Fixed values before passing them
 *      to this function (see FixMath.h for conversion functions). Pass

 *  ATSUGetUnjustifiedBounds()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CTLineGetTypographicBounds or
 *    CTLineGetTrailingWhitespaceWidth instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the typographic bounding rectangle for a line of text
 *    prior to final layout.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function calculates the typographic bounds (in coordinates
 *    independent of the rendering device) for a line of text. Note
 *    that ATSUGetUnjustifiedBounds calculates these bounds prior to
 *    the text's final layout, and therefore, the calculated bounds
 *    might not reflect those of the final laid-out line.
 *    Justification, truncation, and device level positioning are not
 *    taken into account. To obtain the typographic bounds of a line
 *    after it is laid out, you can call the function
 *    ATSUGetGlyphBounds. For more infomration about the difference
 *    between typographic and image bounds, please refer to the ATSUI
 *    documentation. Note that ATSUGetUnjustifiedBounds treats the
 *    specified text range as a single line. That is, if the range of
 *    text you specify is less than a line, it nevertheless treats the
 *    initial character in the range as the start of a line, for
 *    measuring purposes. If the range of text extends beyond a line,
 *    ATSUGetUnjustifiedBounds ignores soft line breaks, again,
 *    treating the text as a single line.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The text layout object to obtain bounds information for.
 *    
 *    iLineStart:
 *      The start of the line of text to obtain bounds information for.
 *      To indicate that the line starts at the beginning of the text
 *      buffer, you can pass the constant kATSUFromTextBeginning . To
 *      specify the entire text buffer, pass kATSUFromTextBeginning in
 *      this parameter and kATSUToTextEnd in the iLineLength parameter.
 *    
 *    iLineLength:
 *      The length of the line to obtain bounds information for. If you
 *      want the line to extend to the end of the text buffer, you can
 *      pass the constant kATSUToTextEnd .
 *    
 *    oTextBefore:
 *      On return, the value specifies the starting point of the
 *      typographic bounds for the line, relative to the origin (0,0)
 *      of the line and taking into account cross-stream shifting. Note
 *      that the ATSUMeasureText function might produce negative values
 *      for the typographic starting point of the line if, for example,
 *      the initial character of the line is allowed to hang into the
 *      margin. For horizontal text, this value corresponds to the left
 *      side of the bounding rectangle.
 *    
 *    oTextAfter:
 *      On return, the end point of the typographic bounds for the
 *      line, relative to the origin (0,0) of the line and taking into
 *      account cross-stream shifting. For horizontal text, this value
 *      corresponds to the right side of the bounding rectangle.
 *    
 *    oAscent:
 *      On return, the typographic bounds for the line, relative to the
 *      origin (0,0) of the line and taking into account cross-stream
 *      shifting. For horizontal text, this value corresponds to the
 *      top side of the bounding rectangle.
 *    
 *    oDescent:
 *      On return, the typographic bounds for the line, relative to the
 *      origin (0,0) of the line and taking into account cross-stream
 *      shifting. For horizontal text, this value corresponds to the

 *  ATSUMeasureTextImage()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CTLineGetImageBounds or CTRunGetImageBounds instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the image bounding rectangle for a line of text after
 *    final layout.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function obtains the image bounds of a laid-out line of
 *    text. These bounds are described by the smallest rectangle that
 *    completely encloses the filled or framed parts of a block of
 *    textÑthat is, the text's "inked" glyphs. In measuring the line,
 *    the ATSUMeasureTextImage function takes into account line
 *    rotation, alignment, and justification, as well as other
 *    characteristics that affect layout, such as hanging punctuation.
 *    (If the line is rotated, the sides of the rectangle are parallel
 *    to the coordinate axes and encompass the rotated line.) If no
 *    attributes are set for the line, ATSUMeasureTextImage uses the
 *    global attributes set for the text layout object. Because the
 *    height of the image bounding rectangle is determined by the
 *    actual device metrics, ATSUMeasureTextImage ignores any
 *    previously set line ascent and descent values for the line it is
 *    measuring.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The text layout for which to obtain image bounds.
 *    
 *    iLineOffset:
 *      The first character of the line to examine. To indicate that
 *      the specified line starts at the beginning of the text buffer,
 *      you can pass the constant kATSUFromTextBeginning . To specify
 *      the entire text buffer, pass kATSUFromTextBeginning in this
 *      parameter and kATSUToTextEnd in the iLineLength parameter.
 *    
 *    iLineLength:
 *      The length of the text range. If you want the range of text to
 *      extend to the end of the text buffer, you can pass the constant
 *      kATSUToTextEnd . However, the image bounds is restricted to the
 *      line in which iLineOffset resides.
 *    
 *    iLocationX:
 *      The x-coordinate of the line's origin in the current graphics
 *      port or Quartz graphics context. Pass the constant
 *      kATSUUseGrafPortPenLoc for the dimensions of the bounds
 *      relative to the current pen location in the current graphics
 *      port or graphics context. You can pass 0to obtain only the
 *      dimensions of the bounding rectangle relative to one another,
 *      not their actual onscreen position.
 *    
 *    iLocationY:
 *      The y-coordinate of the line's origin in the current graphics
 *      port or Quartz graphics context. Pass the constant
 *      kATSUUseGrafPortPenLoc for the dimensions of the bounds
 *      relative to the current pen location in the current graphics

 *      dimensions of the bounding rectangle relative to one another,
 *      not their actual onscreen position.
 *    
 *    oTextImageRect:
 *      On return, the dimensions of the image bounding rectangle for
 *      the text, offset by the values specified in the iLocationX and
 *      iLocationY parameters. If the line is rotated, the sides of the
 *      rectangle are parallel to the coordinate axis.

 *  ATSUGetGlyphBounds()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CTRunGetTypographicBounds, CTLineGetTypographicBounds,
 *    CTFontGetAscent, CTFontGetDescent, CTFontGetLeading, or
 *    CTFontGetUnitsPerEm instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the typographic bounds of a line of glyphs after final
 *    layout.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function produces the enclosing trapezoid(s) that represent
 *    the typographic bounds for glyphs in a final, laid-out range of
 *    text. You typically call this function when you need to obtain an
 *    enclosing trapezoid for a line, taking rotation and all other
 *    layout attributes into account. ATSUI determines the height of
 *    each trapezoid by examining any line ascent and descent attribute
 *    values you may have set for the line. If you have not set these
 *    attributes for the line, the ATSUGetGlyphBounds function uses any
 *    line ascent and descent values you may have set for the text
 *    layout object containing the line. If these are not set,
 *    ATSUGetGlyphBounds uses the font's natural line ascent and
 *    descent values for the line. If these are previously set,
 *    ATSUGetGlyphBounds uses the ATSUStyle ascent and or
 *    descent/leading values. Note that the coordinates produced for
 *    the trapezoid(s) are offset by the amount specified in the
 *    iTextBasePointX and iTextBasePointY parameters. If your goal in
 *    calling the ATSUGetGlyphBounds function is to obtain metrics for
 *    drawing the typographic bounds on the screen, pass the position
 *    of the origin of the line in the current graphics port or
 *    graphics context in these parameters. This enables
 *    ATSUGetGlyphBounds to match the trapezoids to their onscreen
 *    image. When the range specified by the iBoundsCharStart and
 *    iBoundsCharLength parameters covers an entire line, you are
 *    guaranteed to receive only one trapezoid on return. Otherwise,
 *    multiple trapezoids may be returned to cover incomplete sections
 *    of bidi runs. In such cases, you would typically call
 *    ATSUGetGlyphBounds twice, as follows: (1) Pass NULL for the
 *    oGlyphBounds parameter, 0 for the iMaxNumberOfBounds parameter,
 *    and valid values for the other parameters. The ATSUGetGlyphBounds
 *    function returns the actual number of trapezoids needed to
 *    enclose the glyphs in the oActualNumberOfBounds parameter. (2)
 *    Allocate enough space for a buffer of the returned size, then
 *    call the function again, passing a valid pointer to the buffer in
 *    the oGlyphBounds parameter. On return, the buffer contains the
 *    trapezoids for the glyphs' typographic bounds. To obtain the
 *    typographic bounds of a line of text prior to line layout, call
 *    the function ATSUGetUnjustifiedBounds. To calculate the image
 *    bounding rectangle for a final laid-out line, call the function
 *    ATSUMeasureTextImage. For more infomration about the difference
 *    between typographic and image bounds, please refer to the ATSUI
 *    documentation.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The text layout object for which glyph bounds are to be
 *      obtained.
 *    
 *    iTextBasePointX:
 *      The x-coordinate of the origin of the line containing the
 *      glyphs in the current graphics port or Quartz graphics context.
 *      Pass the constant kATSUUseGrafPortPenLoc to obtain the glyph
 *      bounds relative to the current pen location in the current
 *      graphics port or graphics context. You may pass 0 to obtain
 *      only the dimensions of the bounds relative to one another, not
 *      their actual onscreen position.
 *    
 *    iTextBasePointY:
 *      The y-coordinate of the origin of the line containing the
 *      glyphs in the current graphics port or Quartz graphics context.
 *      Pass the constant kATSUUseGrafPortPenLoc to obtain the glyph
 *      bounds relative to the current pen location in the current
 *      graphics port or graphics context. You may pass 0 to obtain
 *      only the dimensions of the bounds relative to one another, not
 *      their actual onscreen position.
 *    
 *    iBoundsCharStart:
 *      The offset from the beginning of the text buffer to the
 *      character corresponding to the first glyph to measure. To
 *      indicate that the text range starts at the beginning of the
 *      text buffer, you can pass the constant kATSUFromTextBeginning.
 *    
 *    iBoundsCharLength:
 *      The length of text range to measure. If you want the range to
 *      extend to the end of the text buffer, you can pass the constant
 *      kATSUToTextEnd.
 *    
 *    iTypeOfBounds:
 *      The type of bounds you wish to obtain. See ATSLayoutTypes.h for
 *      a list of possible values to pass in here.
 *    
 *    iMaxNumberOfBounds:
 *      The maximum number of bounding trapezoids to obtain. Typically,
 *      this is equivalent to the number of bounds in the oGlyphBounds
 *      array. To determine this value, see the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oGlyphBounds:
 *      A pointer to memory you have allocated for an array of
 *      ATSTrapezoid values. On return, the array contains a trapezoid
 *      representing the typographic bounds for glyphs in the text
 *      range. If the specified range of text encloses nested
 *      bidirectional text, ATSUGetGlyphBounds produces multiple
 *      trapezoids defining these regions.In ATSUI 1.1, the maximum
 *      number of enclosing trapezoids that can be returned is 31; in
 *      ATSUI 1.2, the maximum number is 127. If you pass a range that
 *      covers an entire line, ATSUGetGlyphBounds always returns only 1
 *      trapezoid. If you are uncertain of how much memory to allocate
 *      for this array, see the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oActualNumberOfBounds:
 *      On return, the value specifies the actual number of enclosing
 *      trapezoids bounding the specified characters. This may be
 *      greater than the value you provide in the iMaxNumberOfBounds
 *      parameter.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    On success, noErr is returned. See MacErrors.h for possible error
 *    codes.

 *    set a soft break in a given range of text. It suggests a soft
 *    line break each time it encounters a hard line break character
 *    such as a carriage return, line feed, form feed, line separator,
 *    or paragraph separator. If ATSUBreakLine does not encounter a
 *    hard line break, it uses the line width you specify to determine
 *    how many characters fit on a line and suggests soft line breaks
 *    accordingly. You can loop over ATSUBreakLine, repeatedly calling
 *    it on the same layout, until all the text in the entire layout
 *    has been soft wrapped. However, for maximum efficiency, you
 *    should use ATSUBatchBreakLines. ATSUBreakLine should only be used
 *    if you have special needs, such as a non-constant line width.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout containing text to be soft wrapped.
 *    
 *    iLineStart:
 *      The beginning of the line you wish to soft wrap. To specify the
 *      beginning of the text buffer, pass the constant
 *      kATSUFromTextBeginning.
 *    
 *    iLineWidth:
 *      The line width at which to force soft wrapping of text. Note
 *      that this parameter is of type ATSUTextMeasurement, which is
 *      defined as Fixed. See FixMath.h for conversion routines for
 *      fixed point values.
 *    
 *    iUseAsSoftLineBreak:
 *      A Boolean value indicating whether ATSUBreakLine should
 *      automatically set the line break produced in the oLineBreak
 *      parameter. If true ,ATSUBreakLine sets the line break and
 *      clears any previously-set soft line breaks that precede the new
 *      break in the line but lie after the offset specified by
 *      iLineStart. You should ususally pass true for this parameter,
 *      unless you plan to use ATSUSetSoftLineBreak to set the soft
 *      break somewhere other than what is suggested by ATSUBreakLine.
 *    
 *    oLineBreak:
 *      On return, the value specifies the soft line break as
 *      determined by ATSUBreakLine. If the value returned is the same
 *      value as specified in iLineStart , you have made an input
 *      parameter error. In this case, check to make sure that the line
 *      width specified in iLineWidth is big enough for ATSUBreakLine
 *      to perform line breaking. ATSUBreakLine does not return an
 *      error in this case.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    On success, noErr is returned. TSUI usually calculates a soft
 *    line break to be at the beginning of the first word that does ont
 *    fit on the line. But if ATSUBreakLine calculates the most optimal
 *    line break to be in the middle of a word, it returns the result
 *    code kATSULineBreakInWord. Note that ATSUI produces a line break
 *    in the middle of a word only as a last resort. See MacErrors.h
 *    for other possible error codes.

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Typically you use the function ATSUGetSoftLineBreaks by calling
 *    it twice, as follows: (1) Pass valid values for the iTextLayout,
 *    iRangeStart, iRangeLength, and oBreakCount parameters. Pass NULL
 *    for the oBreaks parameter and 0 for the iMaximumBreaks parameter.
 *    ATSUGetSoftLineBreaks returns the size of the font array in the
 *    oBreakCount parameter. (2) Allocate enough space for an array of
 *    the returned size, then call the function again, passing a valid
 *    pointer in the oBreaks parameter. On return, the pointer refers
 *    to an array containing the text range's soft line breaks. If you
 *    have just called ATSUBatchBreakLines, the oBreakCount parameter
 *    will give you the value you would normally obtain from step 1,
 *    allowing you to skip this step in such cases.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      A text layout to obtain a list of soft breaks from.
 *    
 *    iRangeStart:
 *      The beginning of the range of text for which to obtain a list
 *      of softbreaks. To indicate that the specified text range starts
 *      at the beginning of the text buffer, you can pass the constant
 *      kATSUFromTextBeginning, To specify the entire text buffer, pass
 *      kATSUFromTextBeginning in this parameter and kATSUToTextEnd in
 *      the iRangeLength parameter.
 *    
 *    iRangeLength:
 *      The end of the range of text for which to obtain a list of
 *      softbreaks. If you want the range of text to extend to the end
 *      of the text buffer, you can pass the constant kATSUToTextEnd.
 *    
 *    iMaximumBreaks:
 *      The maximum number of soft line breaks to obtain. Typically,
 *      this is equivalent to the number of UniCharArrayOffset values
 *      for which you have allocated memory in the oBreaks array. To
 *      determine this value, see the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oBreaks:
 *      On return, the array contains offsets from the beginning of the

 *

 *  ATSUSetHighlightingMethod()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CTLineGetOffsetForStringIndex,

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Specifies the methods ATSUI will use for highlighting and
 *    unhighlighting text in a given layout.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    By default, ATSUI highlights text by "inverting" the region
 *    containing the text, that is, its background color. Although
 *    inversion provides satisfactory highlighting in most cases, it
 *    does not always provide the best result for grayscale text. (Mac
 *    OS X sets a lower threshold for antialiasing, while in Mac OS 9
 *    grayscale text can be turned off by the user.) In Mac OS X, when
 *    using a Quartz graphics context, you can instruct ATSUI to use
 *    the redraw method of highlighting, rather than simple inversion.
 *    (Note that Cocoa applications always use the redraw method of
 *    highlighting.) The redraw method allows for accurate highlighting
 *    of more complex backgrounds, such as those containing multiple
 *    colors, patterns, or pictures. To set redrawing on, call the
 *    ATSUSetHighlightingMethod function and specify that the redraw
 *    method be used (by passing kRedrawHighlighting in the iMethod
 *    parameter). If you specify the redraw method of highlighting when
 *    you call ATSUSetHighlightingMethod, then you must also specify
 *    how the background is to be redrawn when the function
 *    ATSUUnhighlightText is called. ATSUI can restore the desired
 *    background in one of two ways, depending on the background's
 *    complexity: (1) When the background is a single color (such as
 *    white), ATSUI can readily unhighlight the background. In such a
 *    case, you specify the background color that ATSUI uses by calling
 *    ATSUSetHighlightingMethod and setting iUnhighlightData.dataType
 *    to kATSUBackgroundColor and providing the background color in
 *    iUnhighlightData.unhighlightData. With these settings defined,
 *    when you call ATSUUnhighlightText, ATSUI simply calculates the
 *    previously highlighted area, repaints it with the specified
 *    background color, and then redraws the text. (2) When the
 *    background is more complex (containing, for example, multiple
 *    colors, patterns, or pictures), you must provide a redraw
 *    background callback function when you call
 *    ATSUSetHighlightingMethod. You do this by setting
 *    iUnhighlightData.dataType to kATSUBackgroundCallback and
 *    providing a RedrawBackgroundUPP in
 *    iUnhighlightData.unhighlightData . Then when you call
 *    ATSUUnhighlightText and ATSUI calls your callback, you are
 *    responsible for redrawing the background of the unhighlighted
 *    area. If you choose to also redraw the text, then your callback
 *    should return false as a function result. If your callback
 *    returns true ATSUI redraws any text that needs to be redrawn. See
 *    RedrawBackgroundProcPtr for additional information.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout to which this highlight method should be applied.
 *    
 *    iMethod:
 *      The type of highlighting to use; inversion
 *      (kInvertHighlighting) or redrawing (kRedrawHighlighting). The
 *      default is inversion. If you are happy with that technique
 *      there is no reason to call this function.
 *    
 *    iUnhighlightData:
 *      Data needed to redraw the background or NULL if inversion is
 *      being chosen. See the definition of ATSUUnhighlightData for
 *      more information about the possible contents of this structure.
 *      Also see the Discussion for this function.

 *  Summary:
 *    Renders a highlighted range of text at a specified location in a

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    When the user selects a series of glyphs, the characters in

 *    operation is to occur. The characters in a selection range are

 *    not necessarily so onscreen. If the selection range crosses a
 *    direction boundary, it is appropriate to display discontinuous
 *    highlighting. The ATSUHighlightText function renders a
 *    highlighted range of text at a specified location in a QuickDraw
 *    graphics port or Quartz graphics context, using the highlight
 *    information in the graphics port or context. ATSUHighlightText

 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CTLineGetStringIndexForPosition instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the memory offset for the glyph edge nearest a mouse-down
 *    event.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The process of hit-testing text obtains the location of a
 *    mouse-down event relative both to the position of onscreen glyphs
 *    and to the corresponding offset between character codes in
 *    memory. You can then use the location information obtained by
 *    hit-testing to set the insertion point (that is, the caret) or
 *    selection range (for highlighting). Hit-testing text is
 *    complicated by the fact that a given line of text may be
 *    bidirectional. Therefore, the onscreen order of glyphs may not
 *    readily correspond to the storage order of the corresponding
 *    character codes. And the concept of which glyph comes "first" in
 *    a line of text cannot always be limited to the visual terms
 *    "left" and "right." Because of these complexities, it is more
 *    accurate to speak in terms of "leading" and "trailing" edges to
 *    glyphs. A "leading edge" is defined as the edge of a glyph that
 *    you first encounter when you read the text that includes that
 *    glyph. For example, when reading Roman text, you first encounter
 *    the left edge of a Roman glyph. Similarly, the "trailing edge" is
 *    defined as the edge of the glyph encountered last. This function
 *    produces the memory offset corresponding to the glyph edge
 *    nearest the event. If the mouse-down event occurs at a line
 *    direction boundary or within a glyph cluster,
 *    ATSUPositionToOffset produces two offsets. You can then provide
 *    the offset(s) to the ATSUOffsetToPosition function to obtain the
 *    actual caret position(s) for the event. When you call the
 *    ATSUPositionToOffset function, ATSUI examines the Unicode
 *    directionality of the character corresponding to the event
 *    location. The ATSUPositionToOffset function produces a value of
 *    true in the oIsLeading parameter if the offset is leading (that
 *    is, more closely associated with the subsequent character in
 *    memory and therefore indicative of a left-to-right line
 *    direction). It produces a value of false if the offset is
 *    trailing (that is, more closely associated with the preceding
 *    character in memory and indicative of a right-to-left line
 *    direction). Finally, note that when the event occurs beyond the
 *    leftmost or rightmost caret positions of the line (not taking
 *    into account line rotation), such that no glyph corresponds to
 *    the location of the hit, the ATSUPositionToOffset function
 *    produces the primary offset of the closest edge of the line to
 *    the input location. The oIsLeading flag depends on the
 *    directionality of the closest glyph and the side of the line to
 *    which the input location is closest. In this case, the secondary
 *    offset is equal to the primary offset, since no glyph was hit.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout object in which the mouse-down event occurred.
 *    
 *    iLocationX:
 *      The x-coordinate of the event, in local coordinates, relative
 *      to the origin of the line where the event occurred. That is, to
 *      specify the x-coordinate value, you should subtract the
 *      x-coordinate of the line origin from the x-coordinate of the
 *      hit point (in local coordinates). You can pass the constant
 *      kATSUUseGrafPortPenLoc for the location of the mouse-down event
 *      relative to the current pen location in the current graphics
 *      port.
 *    
 *    iLocationY:
 *      The y-coordinate of the event, in local coordinates, relative
 *      to the origin of the line where the event occurred. That is, to
 *      specify the y-coordinate value, you should subtract the
 *      y-coordinate of the line origin from the y-coordinate of the
 *      hit point (in local coordinates). You can pass the constant
 *      kATSUUseGrafPortPenLoc for the location of the mouse-down event
 *      relative to the current pen location in the current graphics
 *      port.
 *    
 *    ioPrimaryOffset:
 *      On input, a pointer to a UniCharArrayOffset value specifying
 *      the offset corresponding to the beginning of the line where the
 *      event occurred. On return, the value specifies the offset
 *      corresponding to the glyph edge that is visually closest to the
 *      event. To determine whether this offset indicates the leading
 *      or trailing edge of the glyph, you can examine the value
 *      produced in the oIsLeading parameter.
 *    
 *    oIsLeading:
 *      On return, the value indicates whether the offset produced in
 *      the ioPrimaryOffset parameter is leading or trailing. The
 *      function ATSUPositionToOffset produces a value of true if the
 *      offset is leading (that is, more closely associated with the
 *      subsequent character in memory). It produces a value of false
 *      if the offset is trailing (that is, more closely associated
 *      with the preceding character in memory).
 *    
 *    oSecondaryOffset:
 *      On return, the value typically specifies the same offset as
 *      that produced in the ioPrimaryOffset parameter, unless the
 *      event occurred within a glyph cluster or at a line direction
 *      boundary. If so, the value specifies a secondary offset. The

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the caret position(s) corresponding to a memory offset.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function produces two structures of type ATSUCaret. These
 *    structures contain the pen positioning information needed to draw
 *    the caret(s) for the event, specified relative to the origin of
 *    the line in the current graphics port or graphics context.
 *    Specifically, the ATSUCaret structures contain x-y coordinates
 *    for both the caret's starting and ending pen positions (the
 *    latter taking into account line rotation, caret slanting, and
 *    split-caret appearances). If the offset you pass to
 *    ATSUOffsetToPosition is at a line boundary, the structure
 *    produced in the oMainCaret parameter contains the starting and
 *    ending pen locations for the high caret, while the oSecondCaret
 *    parameter contains the corresponding values for the low caret. If
 *    the offset is not at a line boundary, both parameters contain the
 *    starting and ending pen locations of the main caret. Because you
 *    provide the ATSUOffsetToPosition function an offset relative to
 *    the origin of the line where the hit occurred,
 *    ATSUOffsetToPosition produces positioning information that is
 *    also relative. Therefore, you must transform the positions
 *    produced by the ATSUOffsetToPosition function before drawing the
 *    caret(s). To transform the caret location(s), add the starting
 *    and ending caret coordinates to the coordinates of the origin of
 *    the line in which the hit occurred. For example, if
 *    ATSUOffsetToPosition produces starting and ending pen locations
 *    of (25,0), (25,25) in the oMainCaret parameter (and the
 *    oSecondCaret parameter contains the same coordinates, meaning
 *    that the caret was not split), you would add these to the
 *    position of the origin of the line in the graphics port or
 *    context. If the position of the line origin was at (50,50), then
 *    the starting and ending pen locations of the caret would be
 *    (75,50), (75,75).
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout containing the offset.
 *    
 *    iOffset:
 *      The offset into the text buffer for which you wish to obtain a
 *      caret position. To respond to a mouse-down event, pass the
 *      offset returned in the ioPrimaryOffset parameter from the
 *      function ATSUPositionToOffset. That is, the offset
 *      corresponding to the glyph edge closest to the event.
 *    
 *    iIsLeading:
 *      A Boolean value indicating whether the offset corresponds to
 *      the leading or trailing edge of the glyph. You can obtain this
 *      information from the function ATSUPositionToOffset. This value
 *      is relevant if the offset occurs at a line direction boundary
 *      or within a glyph cluster.
 *    
 *    oMainCaret:
 *      On return, contains the starting and ending pen locations of
 *      the high caret if the value produced in oCaretIsSplit is true.
 *      If the value is false, the structure contains the starting and
 *      ending pen locations of the main caret.
 *    
 *    oSecondCaret:
 *      On return, contains the starting and ending pen locations of
 *      the low caret if the value passed back in the oCaretIsSplit
 *      parameter is true. If the value is false, the structure
 *      contains the starting and ending pen locations of the main
 *      caret (that is, the same values as the oMainCaret parameter).
 *    
 *    oCaretIsSplit:
 *      On return, indicates whether the offset specified in the
 *      iOffset parameter occurs at a line direction boundary. If true,
 *      the offset occurs at a line direction boundary; otherwise,

 *    Together with ATSUPreviousCursorPosition, this function allows an
 *    application to "walk" the text buffer in storage order, moving
 *    the cursor by a specified amount and movement type at each step.
 *    To move through the text buffer in screen order, use the
 *    functions ATSURightwardCursorPosition and
 *    ATSULeftwardCursorPosition.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout in which to perform the cursor movement.
 *    
 *    iOldOffset:
 *      The previous cursor position.
 *    
 *    iMovementType:
 *      A constant specifying the unit of cursor movement. See the
 *      definition of ATSUCursorMovementType for possible values to
 *      pass for this parameter.
 *    
 *    oNewOffset:
 *      On return, the new cursor position.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    On success, noErr is returned. See MacErrors.h for possible error
 *    codes.
