	@typedef	CMClock
	@abstract	A timing source object.
	@discussion
		A clock represents a source of time information: generally, a piece of hardware that measures the passage of time.  
		One example of a clock is the host time clock, accessible via CMClockGetHostTimeClock().  
		It measures time using the CPU system clock, which on Mac OS X is mach_absolute_time().
		Every audio device can also be considered a clock since the audio samples that it outputs or inputs each have a 
		defined duration (eg, 1/48000 of a second for 48 kHz audio).
		
		CMClocks are read-only: they cannot be stopped or started, and the current time cannot be set.
		A CMClock has one primary function, CMClockGetTime, which tells what time it is now.  
		Additionally, the CMSync infrastructure monitors relative drift between CMClocks.

/*!
	@typedef	CMTimebase
	@abstract	Models a timeline under application control.
	@discussion
		A timebase represents a timeline that clients can control by setting the rate and time.
		Each timebase has either a master clock or a master timebase.  
		The rate of the timebase is expressed relative to its master. 
		When a timebase has rate 0.0, its time is fixed and does not change as its master's time changes.
		When a timebase has rate 1.0, its time increases one second as its master's time increases by one second.
		When a timebase has rate 2.0, its time increases two seconds as its master's time increases by one second.
		When a timebase has rate -1.0, its time decreases one second as its master's time increases by one second.
		
		If a timebase has a master timebase, the master timebase's rate is a factor in determining the timebase's effective rate.
		In fact, a timebase's effective rate is defined as the product of its rate, its master timebase's rate, 
		its master timebase's master timebase's rate, and so on up to the ultimate master clock.  This is the rate at which
		the timebase's time changes relative to the ultimate master clock.
