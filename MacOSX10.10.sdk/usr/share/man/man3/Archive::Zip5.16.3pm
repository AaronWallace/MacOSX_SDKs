.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
The Archive::Zip module allows a Perl program to create, manipulate, read,
and write Zip archive files.
.PP
Zip archives can be created, or you can read from existing zip files.
.PP
Once created, they can be written to files, streams, or strings. Members
can be added, removed, extracted, replaced, rearranged, and enumerated.
They can also be renamed or have their dates, comments, or other attributes
queried or modified. Their data can be compressed or uncompressed as needed.
.PP
Members can be created from members in existing Zip files, or from existing
directories, files, or strings.
.PP
This module uses the Compress::Raw::Zlib library to read and write the
compressed streams inside the files.
.PP
One can use Archive::Zip::MemberRead to read the zip file archive members
as if they were files.
.SS "File Naming"
.IX Subsection "File Naming"
Regardless of what your local file system uses for file naming, names in a
Zip file are in Unix format (\fIforward\fR slashes (/) separating directory
names, etc.).
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`Archive::Zip\*(C'\fR tries to be consistent with file naming conventions, and will
translate back and forth between native and Zip file names.
.PP
However, it can't guess which format names are in. So two rules control what
kind of file name you must pass various routines:
.IP "Names of files are in local format." 4
.IX Item "Names of files are in local format."
\&\f(CW\*(C`File::Spec\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`File::Basename\*(C'\fR are used for various file
operations. When you're referring to a file on your system, use its
file naming conventions.
.IP "Names of archive members are in Unix format." 4
.IX Item "Names of archive members are in Unix format."
This applies to every method that refers to an archive member, or
provides a name for new archive members. The \f(CW\*(C`extract()\*(C'\fR methods
that can take one or two names will convert from local to zip names
if you call them with a single name.
.SS "Archive::Zip Object Model"
.IX Subsection "Archive::Zip Object Model"
.SS "Overview"
.IX Subsection "Overview"
Archive::Zip::Archive objects are what you ordinarily deal with.
These maintain the structure of a zip file, without necessarily
holding data. When a zip is read from a disk file, the (possibly
compressed) data still lives in the file, not in memory. Archive
members hold information about the individual members, but not
(usually) the actual member data. When the zip is written to a
(different) file, the member data is compressed or copied as needed.
It is possible to make archive members whose data is held in a string
in memory, but this is not done when a zip file is read. Directory
members don't have any data.

.IX Header "ERROR CODES"
Many of the methods in Archive::Zip return error codes. These are implemented
as inline subroutines, using the \f(CW\*(C`use constant\*(C'\fR pragma. They can be imported
into your namespace using the \f(CW\*(C`:ERROR_CODES\*(C'\fR tag:
.PP
.Vb 1

.IP "\s-1AZ_STREAM_END\s0 (1)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_STREAM_END (1)"

.IP "\s-1AZ_ERROR\s0 (2)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_ERROR (2)"

.IP "\s-1AZ_FORMAT_ERROR\s0 (3)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_FORMAT_ERROR (3)"
There is a format error in a \s-1ZIP\s0 file being read.
.IP "\s-1AZ_IO_ERROR\s0 (4)" 4
.IX Item "AZ_IO_ERROR (4)"
There was an \s-1IO\s0 error.
.SS "Compression"
.IX Subsection "Compression"
Archive::Zip allows each member of a \s-1ZIP\s0 file to be compressed (using the
Deflate algorithm) or uncompressed.
.PP
Other compression algorithms that some versions of \s-1ZIP\s0 have been able to
produce are not supported. Each member has two compression methods: the
one it's stored as (this is always \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 for string and external
file members), and the one you desire for the member in the zip file.
.PP
These can be different, of course, so you can make a zip member that is not
compressed out of one that is, and vice versa.
.PP
You can inquire about the current compression and set the desired
compression method:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&  my $member = $zip\->memberNamed( \*(Aqxyz.txt\*(Aq );
\&  $member\->compressionMethod();    # return current compression
\&  
\&  # set to read uncompressed
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
\&  
\&  # set to read compressed
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_DEFLATED );
.Ve
.PP
There are two different compression methods:
.IP "\s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_STORED"
File is stored (no compression)
.IP "\s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_DEFLATED"
File is Deflated
.SS "Compression Levels"
.IX Subsection "Compression Levels"
If a member's desiredCompressionMethod is \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0, you
can choose different compression levels. This choice may affect the
speed of compression and decompression, as well as the size of the
compressed member data.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionLevel( 9 );
.Ve
.PP
The levels given can be:
.IP "0 or \s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE\s0" 4
.IX Item "0 or COMPRESSION_LEVEL_NONE"
This is the same as saying
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  $member\->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
.Ve
.IP "1 .. 9" 4
.IX Item "1 .. 9"
1 gives the best speed and worst compression, and 9 gives the
best compression and worst speed.
.IP "\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_LEVEL_FASTEST"
This is a synonym for level 1.
.IP "\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_LEVEL_BEST_COMPRESSION"
This is a synonym for level 9.
.IP "\s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT\s0" 4
.IX Item "COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT"
This gives a good compromise between speed and compression,
and is currently equivalent to 6 (this is in the zlib code).
This is the level that will be used if not specified.
.SH "Archive::Zip Methods"
.IX Header "Archive::Zip Methods"
The Archive::Zip class (and its invisible subclass Archive::Zip::Archive)
implement generic zip file functionality. Creating a new Archive::Zip object
actually makes an Archive::Zip::Archive object, but you don't have to worry
about this unless you're subclassing.
.SS "Constructor"
.IX Subsection "Constructor"
.IP "new( [$fileName] )" 4
.IX Item "new( [$fileName] )"
Make a new, empty zip archive.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $zip = Archive::Zip\->new();
.Ve
.Sp
If an additional argument is passed, \fInew()\fR will call \fIread()\fR
to read the contents of an archive:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $zip = Archive::Zip\->new( \*(Aqxyz.zip\*(Aq );
.Ve
.Sp
If a filename argument is passed and the read fails for any
reason, new will return undef. For this reason, it may be
better to call read separately.
.SS "Zip Archive Utility Methods"
.IX Subsection "Zip Archive Utility Methods"
These Archive::Zip methods may be called as functions or as object
methods. Do not call them as class methods:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $zip = Archive::Zip\->new();
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( \*(Aqghijkl\*(Aq );    # OK
\&    $crc = $zip\->computeCRC32( \*(Aqghijkl\*(Aq );            # also OK

.el .IP "Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( \f(CW$string\fR [, \f(CW$crc\fR] )" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string [, $crc] )"
This is a utility function that uses the Compress::Raw::Zlib \s-1CRC\s0
routine to compute a \s-1CRC\-32\s0. You can get the \s-1CRC\s0 of a string:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( $string );
.Ve
.Sp
Or you can compute the running \s-1CRC:\s0
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    $crc = 0;
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( \*(Aqabcdef\*(Aq, $crc );
\&    $crc = Archive::Zip::computeCRC32( \*(Aqghijkl\*(Aq, $crc );
.Ve
.ie n .IP "Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( $number )" 4
.el .IP "Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( \f(CW$number\fR )" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( $number )"
Report or change chunk size used for reading and writing.
This can make big differences in dealing with large files.
Currently, this defaults to 32K. This also changes the chunk
size used for Compress::Raw::Zlib. You must call \fIsetChunkSize()\fR
before reading or writing. This is not exportable, so you
must call it like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Archive::Zip::setChunkSize( 4096 );
.Ve
.Sp
or as a method on a zip (though this is a global setting).
Returns old chunk size.
.IP "\fIArchive::Zip::chunkSize()\fR" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::chunkSize()"
Returns the current chunk size:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $chunkSize = Archive::Zip::chunkSize();
.Ve
.IP "Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \e&subroutine )" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( &subroutine )"
Change the subroutine called with error strings. This
defaults to \e&Carp::carp, but you may want to change it to
get the error strings. This is not exportable, so you must
call it like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    Archive::Zip::setErrorHandler( \e&myErrorHandler );
.Ve
.Sp
If myErrorHandler is undef, resets handler to default.
Returns old error handler. Note that if you call Carp::carp
or a similar routine or if you're chaining to the default
error handler from your error handler, you may want to
increment the number of caller levels that are skipped (do
not just set it to a number):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $Carp::CarpLevel++;
.Ve
.IP "Archive::Zip::tempFile( [$tmpdir] )" 4
.IX Item "Archive::Zip::tempFile( [$tmpdir] )"
Create a uniquely named temp file. It will be returned open
for read/write. If \f(CW$tmpdir\fR is given, it is used as the
name of a directory to create the file in. If not given,
creates the file using \f(CW\*(C`File::Spec::tmpdir()\*(C'\fR. Generally, you can
override this choice using the
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $ENV{TMPDIR}
.Ve
.Sp
environment variable. But see the File::Spec
documentation for your system. Note that on many systems, if you're
running in taint mode, then you must make sure that \f(CW$ENV{TMPDIR}\fR is
untainted for it to be used.
Will \fI\s-1NOT\s0\fR create \f(CW$tmpdir\fR if it doesn't exist (this is a change
from prior versions!). Returns file handle and name:
.Sp
.Vb 3

.IX Subsection "Zip Archive Member Operations"
Various operations on a zip file modify members. When a member is
passed as an argument, you can either use a reference to the member
itself, or the name of a member. Of course, using the name requires
that names be unique within a zip (this is not enforced).

Note that if you use the same name as an existing zip file
that you read in, you will clobber ZipFileMembers. So
instead, write to a different file name, then delete the
original.
If you use the \f(CW\*(C`overwrite()\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`overwriteAs()\*(C'\fR methods, you can
re-write the original zip in this way.
\&\f(CW$fileName\fR should be a valid file name on your system.

.el .IP "writeToFileHandle( \f(CW$fileHandle\fR [, \f(CW$seekable\fR] )" 4
.IX Item "writeToFileHandle( $fileHandle [, $seekable] )"
Write a zip archive to a file handle. Return \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on
success. The optional second arg tells whether or not to try
to seek backwards to re-write headers. If not provided, it is
set if the Perl \f(CW\*(C`\-f\*(C'\fR test returns true. This could fail on
some operating systems, though.

.Ve
.Sp
If you pass a file handle that is not seekable (like if
you're writing to a pipe or a socket), pass a false second
argument:

If this method fails during the write of a member, that
member and all following it will return false from

deal with this.
If you want, you can write data to the file handle before
passing it to \fIwriteToFileHandle()\fR; this could be used (for
instance) for making self-extracting archives. However, this
only works reliably when writing to a real file (as opposed
to \s-1STDOUT\s0 or some other possible non-file).

See examples/selfex.pl for how to write a self-extracting
archive.

Writes the central directory structure to the given file

Returns \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success. If given an \f(CW$offset\fR, will
seek to that point before writing. This can be used for
recovery in cases where writeToFileHandle or writeToFileNamed
returns an \s-1IO\s0 error because of running out of space on the
destination file.

Several constructors allow you to construct members without adding
them to a zip archive. These work the same as the \fIaddFile()\fR,
\&\fIaddDirectory()\fR, and \fIaddString()\fR zip instance methods described above,
but they don't add the new members to a zip.

Gets the general purpose bit field from the member header.
This is where the \f(CW\*(C`GPBF_*\*(C'\fR bits live.
.IP "\fIcompressionMethod()\fR" 4
.IX Item "compressionMethod()"
Returns the member compression method. This is the method
that is currently being used to compress the member data.
This will be \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 for added string or file
members, or any of the \f(CW\*(C`COMPRESSION_*\*(C'\fR values for members
from a zip file. However, this module can only handle members
whose data is in \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 or \s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0
format.
.IP "desiredCompressionMethod( [$method] )" 4
.IX Item "desiredCompressionMethod( [$method] )"
Get or set the member's \f(CW\*(C`desiredCompressionMethod\*(C'\fR. This is
the compression method that will be used when the member is
written. Returns prior desiredCompressionMethod. Only
\&\s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0 or \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 are valid
arguments. Changing to \s-1COMPRESSION_STORED\s0 will change the
member desiredCompressionLevel to 0; changing to
\&\s-1COMPRESSION_DEFLATED\s0 will change the member
desiredCompressionLevel to \s-1COMPRESSION_LEVEL_DEFAULT\s0.

.IX Item "unixFileAttributes( [$newAttributes] )"
Get or set the member's file attributes using \s-1UNIX\s0 file
attributes. Returns old attributes.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    my $oldAttribs = $member\->unixFileAttributes( 0666 );

Note that the return value has more than just the file
permissions, so you will have to mask off the lowest bits for
comparisions.
.IP "localExtraField( [$newField] )" 4
.IX Item "localExtraField( [$newField] )"
Gets or sets the extra field that was read from the local
header. This is not set for a member from a zip file until

.IX Item "hasDataDescriptor()"
Get or set the data descriptor flag. If this is set, the
local header will not necessarily have the correct data
sizes. Instead, a small structure will be stored at the end
of the member data with these values. This should be
transparent in normal operation.
.IP "\fIcrc32()\fR" 4
.IX Item "crc32()"
Return the \s-1CRC\-32\s0 value for this member. This will not be set
for members that were constructed from strings or external

Return the \s-1CRC\-32\s0 value for this member as an 8 character
printable hex string. This will not be set for members that
were constructed from strings or external files until after
the member has been written.
.IP "\fIcompressedSize()\fR" 4
.IX Item "compressedSize()"
Return the compressed size for this member. This will not be
set for members that were constructed from strings or
external files until after the member has been written.

.IX Item "uncompressedSize()"
Return the uncompressed size for this member.
.IP "\fIisEncrypted()\fR" 4
.IX Item "isEncrypted()"
Return true if this member is encrypted. The Archive::Zip
module does not currently create or extract encrypted
members.
.IP "isTextFile( [$flag] )" 4
.IX Item "isTextFile( [$flag] )"
Returns true if I am a text file. Also can set the status if
given an argument (then returns old state). Note that this

.IX Item "isBinaryFile()"
Returns true if I am a binary file. Also can set the status
if given an argument (then returns old state). Note that this

extraction or storage. That is, bytes are stored in native
format whether or not they came from a text file.
.ie n .IP "extractToFileNamed( $fileName )" 4
.el .IP "extractToFileNamed( \f(CW$fileName\fR )" 4
.IX Item "extractToFileNamed( $fileName )"
Extract me to a file with the given name. The file will be
created with default modes. Directories will be created as
needed.

Returns true if I was successfully written. Reset at the
beginning of a write attempt.
.SS "Low-level member data reading"
.IX Subsection "Low-level member data reading"
It is possible to use lower-level routines to access member data
streams, rather than the extract* methods and \fIcontents()\fR. For
instance, here is how to print the uncompressed contents of a member
in chunks using these methods:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&    my ( $member, $status, $bufferRef );
\&    $member = $zip\->memberNamed( \*(Aqxyz.txt\*(Aq );
\&    $member\->desiredCompressionMethod( COMPRESSION_STORED );
\&    $status = $member\->rewindData();
\&    die "error $status" unless $status == AZ_OK;
\&    while ( ! $member\->readIsDone() )
\&    {
\&    ( $bufferRef, $status ) = $member\->readChunk();
\&    die "error $status"
\&                if $status != AZ_OK && $status != AZ_STREAM_END;
\&    # do something with $bufferRef:
\&    print $$bufferRef;
\&    }
\&    $member\->endRead();
.Ve
.IP "readChunk( [$chunkSize] )" 4
.IX Item "readChunk( [$chunkSize] )"
This reads the next chunk of given size from the member's
data stream and compresses or uncompresses it as necessary,
returning a reference to the bytes read and a status. If size
argument is not given, defaults to global set by
Archive::Zip::setChunkSize. Status is \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success until
the last chunk, where it returns \s-1AZ_STREAM_END\s0. Returns \f(CW\*(C`(
\&\e$bytes, $status)\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    my ( $outRef, $status ) = $self\->readChunk();
\&    print $$outRef if $status != AZ_OK && $status != AZ_STREAM_END;
.Ve
.IP "\fIrewindData()\fR" 4
.IX Item "rewindData()"
Rewind data and set up for reading data streams or writing
zip files. Can take options for \f(CW\*(C`inflateInit()\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`deflateInit()\*(C'\fR, but this isn't likely to be necessary.
Subclass overrides should call this method. Returns \f(CW\*(C`AZ_OK\*(C'\fR
on success.
.IP "\fIendRead()\fR" 4
.IX Item "endRead()"
Reset the read variables and free the inflater or deflater.
Must be called to close files, etc. Returns \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success.
.IP "\fIreadIsDone()\fR" 4
.IX Item "readIsDone()"
Return true if the read has run out of data or errored out.
.IP "\fIcontents()\fR" 4
.IX Item "contents()"
Return the entire uncompressed member data or undef in scalar
context. When called in array context, returns \f(CW\*(C`( $string,
$status )\*(C'\fR; status will be \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    my $string = $member\->contents();
\&    # or
\&    my ( $string, $status ) = $member\->contents();
\&    die "error $status" unless $status == AZ_OK;
.Ve
.Sp
Can also be used to set the contents of a member (this may
change the class of the member):
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    $member\->contents( "this is my new contents" );
.Ve
.ie n .IP "extractToFileHandle( $fh )" 4
.el .IP "extractToFileHandle( \f(CW$fh\fR )" 4
.IX Item "extractToFileHandle( $fh )"
Extract (and uncompress, if necessary) the member's contents
to the given file handle. Return \s-1AZ_OK\s0 on success.
.SH "Archive::Zip::FileMember methods"
.IX Header "Archive::Zip::FileMember methods"
The Archive::Zip::FileMember class extends Archive::Zip::Member. It is the
base class for both ZipFileMember and NewFileMember classes. This class adds

file.
.IP "\fIexternalFileName()\fR" 4
.IX Item "externalFileName()"
Return the member's external filename.
.IP "\fIfh()\fR" 4
.IX Item "fh()"

.SS "When not to use Archive::Zip"
.IX Subsection "When not to use Archive::Zip"
If you are just going to be extracting zips (and/or other archives) you
are recommended to look at using Archive::Extract instead, as it is much
easier to use and factors out archive-specific functionality.
.SS "Try to avoid IO::Scalar"
.IX Subsection "Try to avoid IO::Scalar"
One of the most common ways to use Archive::Zip is to generate Zip files
in-memory. Most people have use IO::Scalar for this purpose.
.PP
Unfortunately, as of 1.11 this module no longer works with IO::Scalar
as it incorrectly implements seeking.
.PP
Anybody using IO::Scalar should consider porting to IO::String,
which is smaller, lighter, and is implemented to be perfectly compatible
with regular seekable filehandles.
.PP
Support for IO::Scalar most likely will \fBnot\fR be restored in the
future, as IO::Scalar itself cannot change the way it is implemented
due to back-compatibility issues.
