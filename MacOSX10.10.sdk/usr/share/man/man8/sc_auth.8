.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
configures a local user account to permit authentication using a supported

public-key) encryption.  
.Nm
works with signing keys, but not encryption keys.  
.Pp

.It Ar remove
Remove all public keys associated with a user.  
.It Ar hash
Print the hashes for all keys on all inserted cards.  
.It Ar list
List all public keys associated with a user.  
.El                      \" Ends the list

.Sh NOTES
.Nm
is a shell script.  It is intended to be modified by administrators to 
suit their local environments.  
.Pp
.Nm
is only known to work with a local directory.  Consult the script's source
for some limited guidance to using remote directories.  
.Sh BUGS
.Nm
.Ar hash
might display the hashes of encryption keys as well as signing keys, even
though 
.Nm
.Ar accept
does not work with encryption keys.
