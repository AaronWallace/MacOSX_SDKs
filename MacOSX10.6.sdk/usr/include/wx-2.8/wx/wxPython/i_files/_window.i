Styles
-------
    =============================  =====================================
    wx.SIMPLE_BORDER               Displays a thin border around the window.
                                   
    wx.DOUBLE_BORDER               Displays a double border. Windows and Mac only.
                                   
    wx.SUNKEN_BORDER               Displays a sunken border.
                                   
    wx.RAISED_BORDER               Displays a raised border.
                                   
    wx.STATIC_BORDER               Displays a border suitable for a static
                                   control. Windows only.
                                   
    wx.NO_BORDER                   Displays no border, overriding the default
                                   border style for the window.
                                   
    wx.TRANSPARENT_WINDOW          The window is transparent, that is, it
                                   will not receive paint events. Windows only.
                                   
    wx.TAB_TRAVERSAL               Use this to enable tab traversal for
                                   non-dialog windows.
                                   
    wx.WANTS_CHARS                 Use this to indicate that the window
                                   wants to get all char/key events for
                                   all keys - even for keys like TAB or
                                   ENTER which are usually used for
                                   dialog navigation and which wouldn't
                                   be generated without this style. If
                                   you need to use this style in order to
                                   get the arrows or etc., but would
                                   still like to have normal keyboard
                                   navigation take place, you should
                                   create and send a wxNavigationKeyEvent
                                   in response to the key events for Tab
                                   and Shift-Tab.
                                   
    wx.NO_FULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE   Disables repainting the window
                                   completely when its size is changed.
                                   You will have to repaint the new
                                   window area manually if you use this
                                   style. As of version 2.5.1 this
                                   style is on by default.  Use
                                   wx.FULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE to
                                   deactivate it.
                                   
    wx.VSCROLL                     Use this style to enable a vertical scrollbar.
                                   Notice that this style cannot be used with
                                   native controls which don't support scrollbars
                                   nor with top-level windows in most ports.
                                   
    wx.HSCROLL                     Use this style to enable a horizontal scrollbar.
                                   The same limitations as for wx.VSCROLL apply to
                                   this style.

    wx.ALWAYS_SHOW_SB              If a window has scrollbars, disable them
                                   instead of hiding them when they are
                                   not needed (i.e. when the size of the
                                   window is big enough to not require
                                   the scrollbars to navigate it). This
                                   style is currently only implemented
                                   for wxMSW and wxUniversal and does
                                   nothing on the other platforms.
                                   
    wx.CLIP_CHILDREN               Use this style to eliminate flicker caused by
                                   the background being repainted, then
                                   children being painted over
                                   them. Windows only.
                                   
    wx.FULL_REPAINT_ON_RESIZE      Use this style to force a complete
                                   redraw of the window whenever it is
                                   resized instead of redrawing just the
                                   part of the window affected by
                                   resizing. Note that this was the
                                   behaviour by default before 2.5.1
                                   release and that if you experience
                                   redraw problems with the code which
                                   previously used to work you may want
                                   to try this.

Extra Styles
------------
    =============================   =====================================
    wx.WS_EX_VALIDATE_RECURSIVELY   By default,
                                    Validate/TransferDataTo/FromWindow()
                                    only work on direct children of
                                    the window (compatible
                                    behaviour). Set this flag to make
                                    them recursively descend into all
                                    subwindows.

    wx.WS_EX_BLOCK_EVENTS           wx.CommandEvents and the objects of the
                                    derived classes are forwarded to
                                    the parent window and so on
                                    recursively by default. Using this
                                    flag for the given window allows
                                    to block this propagation at this
                                    window, i.e. prevent the events
                                    from being propagated further
                                    upwards. Dialogs have this flag on
                                    by default.

    wx.WS_EX_TRANSIENT              Don't use this window as an implicit parent for
                                    the other windows: this must be
                                    used with transient windows as
                                    otherwise there is the risk of
                                    creating a dialog/frame with this
                                    window as a parent which would
                                    lead to a crash if the parent is
                                    destroyed before the child.

    wx.WS_EX_PROCESS_IDLE           This window should always process idle
                                    events, even if the mode set by
                                    `wx.IdleEvent.SetMode` is
                                    wx.IDLE_PROCESS_SPECIFIED.

    wx.WS_EX_PROCESS_UI_UPDATES     This window should always process UI
                                    update events, even if the mode
                                    set by `wx.UpdateUIEvent.SetMode` is
                                    wxUPDATE_UI_PROCESS_SPECIFIED.

Usually Close is only used with the top level windows (wx.Frame and
wx.Dialog classes) as the others are not supposed to have any special
EVT_CLOSE logic.

The close handler should check whether the window is being deleted
forcibly, using wx.CloseEvent.GetForce, in which case it should
destroy the window using wx.Window.Destroy.

Note that calling Close does not guarantee that the window will be
destroyed; but it provides a way to simulate a manual close of a
window, which may or may not be implemented by destroying the
window. The default EVT_CLOSE handler for wx.Dialog does not
necessarily delete the dialog, since it will simply simulate an
wxID_CANCEL event which is handled by the appropriate button event
handler and may do anything at all.

By 'intelligently' the following is meant: by default, all windows use
their own default attributes. However if some of the parent's
attributes are explicitly changed (that is, using SetFont and not
SetOwnFont) and if the corresponding attribute hadn't been
explicitly set for this window itself, then this window takes the same
value as used by the parent. In addition, if the window overrides
ShouldInheritColours to return false, the colours will not be changed
no matter what and only the font might.

This rather complicated logic is necessary in order to accommodate the
different usage scenarios. The most common one is when all default
attributes are used and in this case, nothing should be inherited as
in modern GUIs different controls use different fonts (and colours)
than their siblings so they can't inherit the same value from the
parent. However it was also deemed desirable to allow to simply change
the attributes of all children at once by just changing the font or
colour of their common parent, hence in this case we do inherit the
parents attributes.
