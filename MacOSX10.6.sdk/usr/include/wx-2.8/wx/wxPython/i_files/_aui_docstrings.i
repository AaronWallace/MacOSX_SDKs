DocStr(wxFrameManager,
"FrameManager manages the panes associated with it for a particular
`wx.Frame`, using a pane's `PaneInfo` information to determine each
pane's docking and floating behavior. FrameManager uses wxWidgets'
sizer mechanism to plan the layout of each frame. It uses a
replaceable `DockArt` class to do all drawing, so all drawing is
localized in one area, and may be customized depending on an
application's specific needs.
",

"
FrameManager works as follows: The programmer adds panes to the
class, or makes changes to existing pane properties (dock position,
floating state, show state, etc.). To apply these changes,
FrameManager's `Update` function is called. This batch processing
can be used to avoid flicker, by modifying more than one pane at a
time, and then \"committing\" all of the changes at once by calling
`Update`.

Panes can be added quite easily::

    text1 = wx.TextCtrl(self, -1)
    text2 = wx.TextCtrl(self, -1)
    self._mgr.AddPane(text1, wx.LEFT, \"Pane Caption\")
    self._mgr.AddPane(text2, wx.BOTTOM, \"Pane Caption\")
    self._mgr.Update()


Later on, the positions can be modified easily. The following will
float an existing pane in a tool window::

    self._mgr.GetPane(text1).Float();


**Layers, Rows and Directions, Positions**

Inside wx.aui the docking layout is figured out by checking several
pane parameters. Four of these are important for determining where a
pane will end up:

    * **Direction**: Each docked pane has a direction, Top, Bottom,
      Left, Right, or Center. This is fairly self-explanatory. The
      pane will be placed in the location specified by this variable.

    * **Position**: More than one pane can be placed inside of a
      \"dock.\"  Imagine two panes being docked on the left side of a
      window. One pane can be placed over another.  In proportionally
      managed docks, the pane position indicates it's sequential
      position, starting with zero. So, in our scenario with two panes
      docked on the left side, the top pane in the dock would have
      position 0, and the second one would occupy position 1.

    * **Row**: A row can allow for two docks to be placed next to each
      other. One of the most common places for this to happen is in
      the toolbar. Multiple toolbar rows are allowed, the first row
      being in row 0, and the second in row 1. Rows can also be used
      on vertically docked panes.

    * **Layer**: A layer is akin to an onion. Layer 0 is the very
      center of the managed pane. Thus, if a pane is in layer 0, it
      will be closest to the center window (also sometimes known as
      the \"content window\"). Increasing layers \"swallow up\" all
      layers of a lower value. This can look very similar to multiple
      rows, but is different because all panes in a lower level yield
      to panes in higher levels. The best way to understand layers is
      by running the AUI sample in the wxPython demo.
