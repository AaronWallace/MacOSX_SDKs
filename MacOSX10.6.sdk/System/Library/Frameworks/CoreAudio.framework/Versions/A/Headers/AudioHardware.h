    @header AudioHardware
    The audio HAL provides an abstraction through which applications can access audio hardware. To
    do this, the HAL provides a small set of AudioObjects that provide access to the various pieces
    of the system.
    
    AudioObjects all have a set of properties that describe and manipulate their state. A property
    is accessed via an ordered triple. The first ordinate is the selector which describes the
    property. The other two ordinates are the scope and element that identify the particular part of
    the object in which to look for the selector. The AudioObjectPropertyAddress structure
    encapsulates the property address. The value of a property is an untyped block of data whose
    content depends on the specifics of the selector. Some selectors also require the use of a
    qualifier when querying. The qualifier allows for additional information to be provided to be
    used in the manipulation of the property. Changing the value of a property is always considered
    asynchronous.
    
    Applications use the routines AudioObjectHasProperty(), AudioObjectIsPropertySettable() and
    AudioObjectGetPropertyDataSize() to find useful meta-information about the property. Apps use
    AudioObjectGetPropertyData() and AudioObjectSetPropertyData() to manipulate the value of the
    property. Apps use AudioObjectAddPropertyListener() and AudioObjectRemovePropertyListener() to
    register/unregister a function that is to be called when a given property's value changes.
    
    The class of an AudioObject determines the basic functionality of the object in terms of what
    functions will operate on it as well as the set of properties that can be expected to be
    implemented by the object. The set of available classes for objects is limited to those defined
    here. There are no other classes. The set of classes is arranged in a hierarchy such that one
    class inherits the properties/routines of it's super class.
    
    The base class for all AudioObjects is the class AudioObject. As such, each AudioObject will 
    provide basic properties such as it's class, it's human readable name, and the other
    AudioObjects it contains. Other important classes include AudioSystemObject, AudioDevice, and
    AudioStream.
    
    The AudioObjects in the HAL are arranged in a containment hierarchy. The root of the hierarchy
    is the one and only instance of the AudioSystemObject class. The properties of the
    AudioSystemObject describe the process global settings such as the various default devices and
    the notification run loop. The AudioSystemObject also contains all the AudioDevices that are
    available.
    
    Instances of the AudioDevice class encapsulate individual audio devices. An AudioDevice serves
    as the basic unit of IO. It provides a single IO cycle, a timing source based on it, and all the
    buffers synchronized to it. The IO cycle presents all the synchronized buffers to the client in
    the same call out along with time stamps that specify the current time, when the input data was
    acquired and when the output data will be presented.
    
    AudioDevices contain instances of the AudioStream class. An AudioStream represents a single
    buffer of data for transferring across the user/kernel boundary. As such, AudioStreams are the
    gatekeepers of format information. Each has it's own format and list of available formats.
    AudioStreams can provide data in any format, including encoded formats and non-audio formats. If
    the format is a linear PCM format, the data will always be presented as 32 bit, native endian
    floating point. All conversions to and from the true physical format of the hardware is handled
    by the device's driver.
    
    Both AudioDevices and AudioStreams can contain instances of the AudioControl class or it's many
    subclasses. An AudioControl provides properties that describe/manipulate a particular aspect of
    the object such as gain, mute, data source selection, etc. Many common controls are also
    also available as properties on the AudioDevice or AudioStream.

    @discussion     These are the error constants that are unique to the HAL. Note that the HAL's
                    functions can and will return other codes that are not listed here. While these
                    constants give a general idea of what might have gone wrong during the execution
                    of an API call, if an API call returns anything other than kAudioHardwareNoError
                    it is to be viewed as the same failure regardless of what constant is actually
                    returned.

/*!
    @enum           AudioDevice Properties
    @abstract       AudioObjectPropertySelector values that apply to AudioDevice objects.
    @discussion     AudioDevices have four scopes: kAudioDevicePropertyScopeGlobal,
                    kAudioDevicePropertyScopeInput, kAudioDevicePropertyScopeOutput, and
                    kAudioDevicePropertyScopePlayThrough. They have a master element and an element
                    for each channel in each stream numbered according to the starting channel
                    number of each stream.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyPlugIn
                        An OSStatus that contains any error codes generated by loading the IOAudio
                        driver plug-in for the AudioDevice or kAudioHardwareNoError if the plug-in
                        loaded successfully. This property only exists for IOAudio-based
                        AudioDevices whose driver has specified a plug-in to load.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyConfigurationApplication
                        A CFString that contains the bundle ID for an application that provides a
                        GUI for configuring the AudioDevice. By default, the value of this property
                        is the bundle ID for Audio MIDI Setup. The caller is responsible for
                        releasing the returned CFObject.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceUID
                        A CFString that contains a persistent identifier for the AudioDevice. An
                        AudioDevice's UID is persistent across boots. The content of the UID string
                        is a black box and may contain information that is unique to a particular
                        instance of an AudioDevice's hardware or unique to the CPU. Therefore they
                        are not suitable for passing between CPUs or for identifying similar models
                        of hardware. The caller is responsible for releasing the returned CFObject.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyModelUID
                        A CFString that contains a persistent identifier for the model of an
                        AudioDevice. The identifier is unique such that the identifier from two
                        AudioDevices are equal if and only if the two AudioDevices are the exact
                        same model from the same manufacturer. Further, the identifier has to be the
                        same no matter on what machine the AudioDevice appears. The caller is
                        responsible for releasing the returned CFObject.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyTransportType
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates how the AudioDevice is connected to the CPU.
                        Constants for some of the values for this property can be found in the enum
                        in the AudioDevice constants section of this file.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyRelatedDevices
                        An array of AudioDeviceIDs for devices related to the AudioDevice. For
                        IOAudio-based devices, a AudioDevices are related if they share the same
                        IOAudioDevice object.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyClockDomain
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates the clock domain to which this AudioDevice
                        belongs. AudioDevices that have the same value for this property are able to
                        be synchronized in hardware. However, a value of 0 indicates that the clock
                        domain for the device is unspecified and should be assumed to be separate
                        from every other device's clock domain, even if they have the value of 0 as
                        their clock domain as well.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsAlive
                        A UInt32 where a value of 1 means the device is ready and available and 0
                        means the device is usable and will most likely go away shortly.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceHasChanged
                        The type of this property is a UInt32, but it's value has no meaning. This
                        property exists so that clients can listen to it and be told when the
                        configuration of the AudioDevice has changed in ways that cannot otherwise
                        be conveyed through other notifications. In response to this notification,
                        clients should re-evaluate everything they need to know about the device,
                        particularly the layout and values of the controls.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunning
                        A UInt32 where a value of 0 means the AudioDevice is not performing IO and
                        a value of 1 means that it is. Note that the device can be running even if
                        there are no active IOProcs such as by calling AudioDeviceStart() and
                        passing a NULL IOProc. Note that the notification for this property is
                        usually sent from the AudioDevice's IO thread.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceIsRunningSomewhere
                        A UInt32 where 1 means that the AudioDevice is running in at least one
                        process on the system and 0 means that it isn't running at all.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceCanBeDefaultDevice
                        A UInt32 where 1 means that the AudioDevice is a possible selection for
                        kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultInputDevice or
                        kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultOutputDevice depending on the scope.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyDeviceCanBeDefaultSystemDevice
                        A UInt32 where 1 means that the AudioDevice is a possible selection for
                        kAudioHardwarePropertyDefaultSystemOutputDevice.
    @constant       kAudioDeviceProcessorOverload
                        A UInt32 where the value has no meaning. This property exists so that
                        clients can be notified when the AudioDevice detects that an IO cycle has
                        run past it's deadline. Note that the notification for this property is
                        usually sent from the AudioDevice's IO thread.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyHogMode
                        A pid_t indicating the process that currently owns exclusive access to the
                        AudioDevice or a value of -1 indicating that the device is currently
                        available to all processes. If the AudioDevice is in a non-mixable mode,
                        the HAL will automatically take hog mode on behalf of the first process to
                        start an IOProc.
                        Note that when setting this property, the value passed in is ignored. If
                        another process owns exclusive access, that remains unchanged. If the
                        current process owns exclusive access, it is released and made available to
                        all processes again. If no process has exclusive access (meaning the current
                        value is -1), this process gains ownership of exclusive access.  On return,
                        the pid_t pointed to by inPropertyData will contain the new value of the
                        property.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyLatency
                        A UInt32 containing the number of frames of latency in the AudioDevice. Note
                        that input and output latency may differ. Further, the AudioDevice's
                        AudioStreams may have additional latency so they should be queried as well.
                        If both the device and the stream say they have latency, then the total
                        latency for the stream is the device latency summed with the stream latency.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates the number of frames in the IO buffers.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSizeRange
                        An AudioValueRange indicating the minimum and maximum values, inclusive, for
                        kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyUsesVariableBufferFrameSizes
                        A UInt32 that, if implemented by a device, indicates that the sizes of the
                        buffers passed to an IOProc will vary by a small amount. The value of this
                        property will indicate the largest buffer that will be passed and
                        kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize will indicate the smallest buffer that
                        will get passed to the IOProc. The usage of this property is narrowed to
                        only allow for devices whose buffer sizes vary by small amounts greater than
                        kAudioDevicePropertyBufferFrameSize. It is not intended to be a license for
                        devices to be able to send buffers however they please. Rather, it is
                        intended to allow for hardware whose natural rhythms lead to this necessity.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyStreams
                        An array of AudioStreamIDs that represent the AudioStreams of the
                        AudioDevice. Note that if a notification is received for this property, any
                        cached AudioStreamIDs for the device become invalid and need to be
                        re-fetched.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertySafetyOffset
                        A UInt32 whose value indicates the number for frames in ahead (for output)
                        or behind (for input the current hardware position that is safe to do IO.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIOCycleUsage
                        A Float32 whose range is from 0 to 1. This value indicates how much of the
                        client portion of the IO cycle the process will use. The client portion of
                        the IO cycle is the portion of the cycle in which the device calls the
                        IOProcs so this property does not the apply to the duration of the entire
                        cycle.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyStreamConfiguration
                        This property returns the stream configuration of the device in an
                        AudioBufferList (with the buffer pointers set to NULL) which describes the
                        list of streams and the number of channels in each stream. This corresponds
                        to what will be passed into the IOProc.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIOProcStreamUsage
                        An AudioHardwareIOProcStreamUsage structure which details the stream usage
                        of a given IO proc. If a stream is marked as not being used, the given
                        IOProc will see a corresponding NULL buffer pointer in the AudioBufferList
                        passed to it's IO proc. Note that the number of streams detailed in the
                        AudioHardwareIOProcStreamUsage must include all the streams of that
                        direction on the device. Also, when getting the value of the property, one
                        must fill out the mIOProc field of the AudioHardwareIOProcStreamUsage with
                        the address of the of the IOProc whose stream usage is to be retrieved.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyPreferredChannelsForStereo
                        An array of two UInt32s, the first for the left channel, the second for the
                        right channel, that indicate the channel numbers to use for stereo IO on the
                        device. The value of this property can be different for input and output and
                        there are no restrictions on the channel numbers that can be used.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyPreferredChannelLayout
                        An AudioChannelLayout that indicates how each channel of the AudioDevice
                        should be used.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyNominalSampleRate
                        A Float64 that indicates the current nominal sample rate of the AudioDevice.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyAvailableNominalSampleRates
                        An array of AudioValueRange structs that indicates the valid ranges for the
                        nominal sample rate of the AudioDevice.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyActualSampleRate
                        A Float64 that indicates the current actual sample rate of the AudioDevice
                        as measured by it's time stamps.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIcon
                        A CFURLRef that indicates an image file that can be used to represent the
                        device visually. The caller is responsible for releasing the returned
                        CFObject.
    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyIsHidden
                        A UInt32 where a non-zero value indicates that the device is not included
                        in the normal list of devices provided by kAudioHardwarePropertyDevices nor
                        can it be the default device. Hidden devices can only be discovered by
                        knowing their UID and using kAudioHardwarePropertyDeviceForUID.

                        This property allows clients to register a fully populated AudioBufferList
                        that matches the topology described by

                        it is supported. AudioStreamBasicDescription fields set to 0 will be ignored
                        in the query, but otherwise values must match exactly.

    @constant       kAudioDevicePropertyStreamFormatMatch
                        An AudioStreamBasicDescription is passed in and the AudioStream will modify
                        it to describe the best match, in the AudioDevice's opinion, for the given

    @discussion     AudioStream is a subclass of AudioObject and has only the single scope,
                    kAudioObjectPropertyScopeGlobal. They have a master element and an element for
                    each channel in the stream numbered upward from 1. Note that AudioStream objects
                    share AudioControl objects with their owning AudioDevice. Consequently, all the
                    standard AudioControl related property selectors implemented by AudioDevices are
                    also implemented by AudioStreams. The same constants are to be used for such
                    properties.
    @constant       kAudioStreamPropertyDirection
                        A UInt32 where a value of 0 means that this AudioStream is an output stream
                        and a value of 1 means that it is an input stream.
    @constant       kAudioStreamPropertyTerminalType
                        A UInt32 whose value describes the general kind of functionality attached
                        to the AudioStream.
    @constant       kAudioStreamPropertyStartingChannel
                        A UInt32 that specifies the first element in the owning device that
                        corresponds to element one of this stream.
    @constant       kAudioStreamPropertyLatency
                        A UInt32 containing the number of frames of latency in the AudioStream. Note
                        that the owning AudioDevice may have additional latency so it should be
                        queried as well. If both the device and the stream say they have latency,
                        then the total latency for the stream is the device latency summed with the
