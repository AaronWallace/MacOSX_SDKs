/*
 *  UpdateSystemActivity()
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    You can use the UpdateSystemActivity function to notify the Power
 *    Manager that activity has taken place .
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The UpdateSystemActivity function is used to notify the Power
 *    Manager that activity has taken place and the timers used to
 *    measure idle time should be updated to the time of this call.
 *    This function can be used by device drivers to prevent the
 *    computer from entering a low-power mode while critical activity
 *    is taking place on a particular device. The function is passed a
 *    parameter indicating the type of activity that has
 *    occurred.
 *    
 *    This function is slightly different from DelaySystemIdle, which
 *    should be used to prevent sleep or idle during a critical
 *    section. UpdateSystemActivity simply updates the tick count for
 *    the activity type selected. Conversely, DelaySystemIdle actually
 *    moves the counter to some number of ticks into the future, which
 *    allows the caller to go off and do somethingwithout fear of
 *    idling.
 *    
 *    The valid types of activity are:
 *    Value Name       Value        Description
 *    OverallAct       0            general type of activity
 *     UsrActivity      1            user activity (i.e.keyboard or
 *    mouse)
 *    NetActivity      2            interaction with network(s)
 *     HDActivity       3            hard disk or storage device in use
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    activity:
 *      The type of activity which has occurred.
