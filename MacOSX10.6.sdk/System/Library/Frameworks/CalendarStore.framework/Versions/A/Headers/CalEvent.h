//  Returns the occurrence date of a CalEvent. Since all instances of a repeating event have the same UID, we need 
//  another way to differentiate between those CalEvents. This method returns the NSDate on which this event was 
//  originally scheduled to occur. This value will remain the same even if the event has been detached and its start 
//  date has changed. For CalEvents not part of a repeating pattern, this method will return the same value as startDate.
