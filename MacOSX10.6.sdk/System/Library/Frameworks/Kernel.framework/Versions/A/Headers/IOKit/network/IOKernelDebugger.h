    @abstract Kernel debugger nub.
    @discussion This object interfaces with the KDP
    (kernel debugger protocol) module and dispatches KDP requests to its
    target (provider). The target, designated as the debugger device, must 
    implement a pair of handler functions that are called to handle KDP 
    transmit and receive requests during a debugging session. Only a single
    IOKernelDebugger in the system can be active at a given time. The
    active IOKernelDebugger is the one that has an IOKDP object attached
    as a client.

    The debugger device is usually a subclass of IOEthernetController.
    However, any IOService can service an IOKernelDebugger client,
    implement the two polled mode handlers, and transport the KDP
    packets through a data channel. However, KDP assumes that the
    debugger device is an Ethernet interface and therefore it will
    always send, and expect to receive, an Ethernet frame. */
