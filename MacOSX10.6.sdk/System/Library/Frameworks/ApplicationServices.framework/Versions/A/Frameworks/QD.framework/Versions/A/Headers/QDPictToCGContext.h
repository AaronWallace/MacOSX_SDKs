    Note: QuickDraw picture data typically comes in two forms: a PICT resource
    that begins the picture header data at the beginning of the resource and PICT
    files that begin with 512 bytes of arbitrary data, followed by
    the picture header data. For this reason, the routines that create a QDPictRef
    attempt to find the picture header data beginning at either the first byte
    of the data provided or at byte 513 of the data provided.
    
    Additionally the Picture Bounds must not be an empty rect.
