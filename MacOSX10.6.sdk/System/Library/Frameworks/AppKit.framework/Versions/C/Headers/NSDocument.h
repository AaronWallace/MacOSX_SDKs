If not successful, return NO after setting *outError to an NSError that encapsulates the reason why the document could not be written. The default implementation of this method:
    1) Either creates a temporary directory in which the document writing should be done, or renames the old on-disk revision of the document, depending on what sort of save operation is being done, whether or not there's already a copy of the document on disk, and the capabilities of the file system to which writing is being done. The details of this are subject to change.
    2) Invokes -writeToURL:ofType:forSaveOperation:originalContentsURL:error:.
    3) Invokes -fileAttributesToWriteToURL:ofType:forSaveOperation:originalContentsURL: and writes the returned attributes, if any, to the file. Some attributes from the old on-disk revision of the document may be copied at the same time, if applicable.
    4) Moves the just-written file to its final location, or deletes the old on-disk revision of the document, and deletes any temporary directories, depending on the same factors listed for step 1.

For NSSaveOperation the default implementation of this method invokes -keepBackupFile to determine whether or not the old on-disk revision of the document, if there was one, should be preserved after being renamed.

For backward binary compatibility with Mac OS 10.3 and earlier, the default implementation of this method instead invokes [self writeWithBackupToFile:[absoluteURL path] ofType:typeName saveOperation:aSaveOperation] if -writeWithBackupToFile:ofType:saveOperation: is overridden and the URL uses the "file:" scheme. The save operation used in this case will never be NSAutosaveOperation; NSSaveToOperation will be used instead.

This method is responsible for doing document writing in a way that minimizes the danger of leaving the disk to which writing is being done in an inconsistent state in the event of an application crash, system crash, hardware failure, power outage, etc. Because it does several different things, and because the things are likely to change in future releases of Mac OS X, it's probably not a good idea to override this method without invoking super (the same was true of -writeWithBackupToFile:ofType:saveOperation:).
