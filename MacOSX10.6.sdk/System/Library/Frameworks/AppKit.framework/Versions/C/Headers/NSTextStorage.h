NSTextStorage is a semi-abstract subclass of NSMutableAttributedString. It implements change management (beginEditing/endEditing), verification of attributes, delegate handling, and layout management notification. The one aspect it does not implement is the actual attributed string storage --- this is left up to the subclassers, which need to override the two NSMutableAttributedString primitives:

  - (void)replaceCharactersInRange:(NSRange)range withString:(NSString *)str;
  - (void)setAttributes:(NSDictionary *)attrs range:(NSRange)range;

These primitives should perform the change then call edited:range:changeInLength: to get everything else to happen.
