 	@class IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel
	@abstract An instance of IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel represents a single open L2CAP channel.
	@discussion	A client won't create IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel objects directly.  Instead, the IOBluetoothDevice's 
                L2CAP channel open API is responsible for opening a new L2CAP channel and returning an
                IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel instance representing that newly opened channel.  Additionally, the IOBluetooth
                notification system will send notifications when new L2CAP channels are open (if requested).
                
                After a new L2CAP channel is opened, the L2CAP configuration process will not be completed until an
                incoming data listener is registered with the IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel object.  The reason for this is
                to due to the limited buffering done of incoming L2CAP data.  This way, we avoid the situation where 
                incoming data is received before the client is ready for it.  Once a client is done with an
                IOBluetoothL2CAPChannel that it opened, it should call -closeChannel.  Additionally, if the client
                does not intend to use the connection to the remote device any further, it should call -closeConnection
                on the IOBluetoothDevice object.
