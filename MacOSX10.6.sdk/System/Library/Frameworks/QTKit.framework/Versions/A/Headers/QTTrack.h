    @abstract		A QTTrack object is an object that represents the ordering and other characteristics 
					of media data in a QTMovie object, such as a single video track or audio track.
 
	@discussion		A QTMovie object typically contains one or more streams of media data, which are represented by
					QTTrack objects. When a QTMovie object has been initialized with QTMovieOpenForPlaybackAttribute set to NO,
					a QTTrack object wraps the underlying QuickTime track (of type Track).
 
					A QTMovie object may have several QTTrack objects associated with it. By constrast, a QTTrack object has
					exactly one QTMedia object associated with it.
