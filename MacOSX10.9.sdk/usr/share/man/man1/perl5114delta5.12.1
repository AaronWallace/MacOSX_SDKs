.\" way too many mistakes in technical documents.
.if n .ad l

.SH "NAME"
perl5114delta \- what is new for perl v5.11.4
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.11.3 release and
the 5.11.4 release.
.PP
If you are upgrading from an earlier release such as 5.11.2, first read
perl5113delta, which describes differences between 5.11.2 and
5.11.3.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Version number formats"
.IX Subsection "Version number formats"
Acceptable version number formats have been formalized into \*(L"strict\*(R" and
\&\*(L"lax\*(R" rules.  \f(CW\*(C`package NAME VERSION\*(C'\fR takes a strict version number.  \f(CW\*(C`use
NAME VERSION\*(C'\fR takes a lax version number.  \f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL::VERSION\*(C'\fR and the
version object constructors take lax version numbers.  Providing an
invalid version will result in a fatal error.
.PP
These formats will be documented fully in the version module in a
subsequent release of Perl 5.11.  To a first approximation, a \*(L"strict\*(R"
version number is a positive decimal number (integer or decimal-fraction)
without exponentiation or else a dotted-decimal v\-string with a leading 'v'
character and at least three components.  A \*(L"lax\*(R" version number allows
v\-strings with fewer than three components or without a leading 'v'.  Under
\&\*(L"lax\*(R" rules, both decimal and dotted-decimal versions may have a trailing
\&\*(L"alpha\*(R" component separated by an underscore character after a fractional
or dotted-decimal component.
.PP
The version module adds \f(CW\*(C`version::is_strict\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`version::is_lax\*(C'\fR
functions to check a scalar against these rules.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Unicode properties"
.IX Subsection "Unicode properties"
\&\f(CW\*(C`\ep{XDigit}\*(C'\fR now matches the same characters as \f(CW\*(C`\ep{Hex_Digit}\*(C'\fR.  This
means that in addition to the characters it currently matches,
\&\f(CW\*(C`[A\-Fa\-f0\-9]\*(C'\fR, it will also match their fullwidth equivalent forms, for
example U+FF10: \s-1FULLWIDTH\s0 \s-1DIGIT\s0 \s-1ZERO\s0.

The two warnings :

.Ve
.Sp
have been moved from the \f(CW\*(C`syntax\*(C'\fR top-level warnings category into a new
first-level category, \f(CW\*(C`illegalproto\*(C'\fR. These two warnings are currently the
only ones emitted during parsing of an invalid/illegal prototype, so one
can now do
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  no warnings \*(Aqillegalproto\*(Aq;
.Ve
.Sp
to suppress only those, but not other syntax-related warnings. Warnings where
prototypes are changed, ignored, or not met are still in the \f(CW\*(C`prototype\*(C'\fR
category as before. (Matt S. Trout)

Perl 5.11.4 is a development release leading up to Perl 5.12.0.

of \s-1RT\s0 #69710, the Perl 5 version 12 meta-ticket.

.IX Item "UNIVERSAL->import()"
The method \f(CW\*(C`UNIVERSAL\->import()\*(C'\fR is now deprecated.  Attempting to
pass import arguments to a \f(CW\*(C`use UNIVERSAL\*(C'\fR statement will result in a
deprecation warning. (This is a less noisy version of the full deprecation
warning added in 5.11.0.)

.SH "Reporting Bugs"
.IX Header "Reporting Bugs"
If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl
bug database at <http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/>.  There may also be
information at <http://www.perl.org/>, the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release.  Be sure to trim your bug down
to a tiny but sufficient test case.  Your bug report, along with the
output of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be
analyzed by the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please send
it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed subscription
unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core committers, who be able
to help assess the impact of issues, figure out a resolution, and help
co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate or fix the problem across all
platforms on which Perl is supported. Please only use this address for
security issues in the Perl core, not for modules independently
distributed on \s-1CPAN\s0.
