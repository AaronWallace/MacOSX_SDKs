This section deals with questions related to networking, the internet,
and a few on the web.
.SS "What is the correct form of response from a \s-1CGI\s0 script?"
.IX Subsection "What is the correct form of response from a CGI script?"
(Alan Flavell <flavell+www@a5.ph.gla.ac.uk> answers...)
.PP
The Common Gateway Interface (\s-1CGI\s0) specifies a software interface between
a program (\*(L"\s-1CGI\s0 script\*(R") and a web server (\s-1HTTPD\s0). It is not specific
to Perl, and has its own FAQs and tutorials, and usenet group,
comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi
.PP
The \s-1CGI\s0 specification is outlined in an informational \s-1RFC:\s0
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3875
.PP
Other relevant documentation listed in: http://www.perl.org/CGI_MetaFAQ.html
.PP
These Perl FAQs very selectively cover some \s-1CGI\s0 issues. However, Perl
programmers are strongly advised to use the \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR module, to take care
of the details for them.
.PP
The similarity between \s-1CGI\s0 response headers (defined in the \s-1CGI\s0
specification) and \s-1HTTP\s0 response headers (defined in the \s-1HTTP\s0
specification, \s-1RFC2616\s0) is intentional, but can sometimes be confusing.
.PP
The \s-1CGI\s0 specification defines two kinds of script: the \*(L"Parsed Header\*(R"
script, and the \*(L"Non Parsed Header\*(R" (\s-1NPH\s0) script. Check your server
documentation to see what it supports. \*(L"Parsed Header\*(R" scripts are
simpler in various respects. The \s-1CGI\s0 specification allows any of the
usual newline representations in the \s-1CGI\s0 response (it's the server's
job to create an accurate \s-1HTTP\s0 response based on it). So \*(L"\en\*(R" written in
text mode is technically correct, and recommended. \s-1NPH\s0 scripts are more
tricky: they must put out a complete and accurate set of \s-1HTTP\s0
transaction response headers; the \s-1HTTP\s0 specification calls for records
to be terminated with carriage-return and line-feed, i.e \s-1ASCII\s0 \e015\e012
written in binary mode.
.PP
Using \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR gives excellent platform independence, including \s-1EBCDIC\s0
systems. \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR selects an appropriate newline representation
(\f(CW$CGI::CRLF\fR) and sets binmode as appropriate.
.SS "My \s-1CGI\s0 script runs from the command line but not the browser.  (500 Server Error)"
.IX Subsection "My CGI script runs from the command line but not the browser.  (500 Server Error)"
Several things could be wrong.  You can go through the \*(L"Troubleshooting
Perl \s-1CGI\s0 scripts\*(R" guide at
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        http://www.perl.org/troubleshooting_CGI.html
.Ve
.PP
If, after that, you can demonstrate that you've read the FAQs and that
your problem isn't something simple that can be easily answered, you'll
probably receive a courteous and useful reply to your question if you
post it on comp.infosystems.www.authoring.cgi (if it's something to do
with \s-1HTTP\s0 or the \s-1CGI\s0 protocols).  Questions that appear to be Perl
questions but are really \s-1CGI\s0 ones that are posted to comp.lang.perl.misc
are not so well received.
.PP
The useful FAQs, related documents, and troubleshooting guides are
listed in the \s-1CGI\s0 Meta \s-1FAQ:\s0

.SS "How can I get better error messages from a \s-1CGI\s0 program?"
.IX Subsection "How can I get better error messages from a CGI program?"
Use the \f(CW\*(C`CGI::Carp\*(C'\fR module.  It replaces \f(CW\*(C`warn\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR, plus the
normal \f(CW\*(C`Carp\*(C'\fR modules \f(CW\*(C`carp\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`croak\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`confess\*(C'\fR functions with
more verbose and safer versions.  It still sends them to the normal
server error log.
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        use CGI::Carp;
\&        warn "This is a complaint";
\&        die "But this one is serious";
.Ve
.PP
The following use of \f(CW\*(C`CGI::Carp\*(C'\fR also redirects errors to a file of your choice,
placed in a \f(CW\*(C`BEGIN\*(C'\fR block to catch compile-time warnings as well:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        BEGIN {
\&                use CGI::Carp qw(carpout);
\&                open(LOG, ">>/var/local/cgi\-logs/mycgi\-log")
\&                        or die "Unable to append to mycgi\-log: $!\en";
\&                carpout(*LOG);
\&        }
.Ve
.PP
You can even arrange for fatal errors to go back to the client browser,
which is nice for your own debugging, but might confuse the end user.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        use CGI::Carp qw(fatalsToBrowser);
\&        die "Bad error here";
.Ve
.PP
Even if the error happens before you get the \s-1HTTP\s0 header out, the module
will try to take care of this to avoid the dreaded server 500 errors.
Normal warnings still go out to the server error log (or wherever
you've sent them with \f(CW\*(C`carpout\*(C'\fR) with the application name and date
stamp prepended.
.SS "How do I remove \s-1HTML\s0 from a string?"
.IX Subsection "How do I remove HTML from a string?"
The most correct way (albeit not the fastest) is to use \f(CW\*(C`HTML::Parser\*(C'\fR
from \s-1CPAN\s0.  Another mostly correct
way is to use \f(CW\*(C`HTML::FormatText\*(C'\fR which not only removes \s-1HTML\s0 but also
attempts to do a little simple formatting of the resulting plain text.
.PP
Many folks attempt a simple-minded regular expression approach, like
\&\f(CW\*(C`s/<.*?>//g\*(C'\fR, but that fails in many cases because the tags
may continue over line breaks, they may contain quoted angle-brackets,
or \s-1HTML\s0 comment may be present.  Plus, folks forget to convert
entities\*(--like \f(CW\*(C`&lt;\*(C'\fR for example.
.PP
Here's one \*(L"simple-minded\*(R" approach, that works for most files:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        #!/usr/bin/perl \-p0777
\&        s/<(?:[^>\*(Aq"]*|([\*(Aq"]).*?\e1)*>//gs
.Ve
.PP
If you want a more complete solution, see the 3\-stage striphtml
program in
http://www.cpan.org/authors/Tom_Christiansen/scripts/striphtml.gz
\&.
.PP
Here are some tricky cases that you should think about when picking
a solution:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        <IMG SRC = "foo.gif" ALT = "A > B">
\&
\&        <IMG SRC = "foo.gif"
\&         ALT = "A > B">
\&
\&        <!\-\- <A comment> \-\->
\&
\&        <script>if (a<b && a>c)</script>
\&
\&        <# Just data #>
\&
\&        <![INCLUDE CDATA [ >>>>>>>>>>>> ]]>
.Ve
.PP
If \s-1HTML\s0 comments include other tags, those solutions would also break
on text like this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&        <!\-\- This section commented out.
\&                <B>You can\*(Aqt see me!</B>
\&        \-\->
.Ve
.SS "How do I extract URLs?"
.IX Subsection "How do I extract URLs?"
You can easily extract all sorts of URLs from \s-1HTML\s0 with
\&\f(CW\*(C`HTML::SimpleLinkExtor\*(C'\fR which handles anchors, images, objects,
frames, and many other tags that can contain a \s-1URL\s0.  If you need
anything more complex, you can create your own subclass of
\&\f(CW\*(C`HTML::LinkExtor\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`HTML::Parser\*(C'\fR.  You might even use
\&\f(CW\*(C`HTML::SimpleLinkExtor\*(C'\fR as an example for something specifically
suited to your needs.
.PP
You can use \f(CW\*(C`URI::Find\*(C'\fR to extract URLs from an arbitrary text document.
.PP
Less complete solutions involving regular expressions can save
you a lot of processing time if you know that the input is simple.  One
solution from Tom Christiansen runs 100 times faster than most
module based approaches but only extracts URLs from anchors where the first
attribute is \s-1HREF\s0 and there are no other attributes.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&        #!/usr/bin/perl \-n00
\&        # qxurl \- tchrist@perl.com
\&        print "$2\en" while m{
\&                < \es*
\&                  A \es+ HREF \es* = \es* (["\*(Aq]) (.*?) \e1

.SS "How do I download a file from the user's machine?  How do I open a file on another machine?"
.IX Subsection "How do I download a file from the user's machine?  How do I open a file on another machine?"
In this case, download means to use the file upload feature of \s-1HTML\s0
forms.  You allow the web surfer to specify a file to send to your web
server.  To you it looks like a download, and to the user it looks
like an upload.  No matter what you call it, you do it with what's
known as \fBmultipart/form\-data\fR encoding.  The \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR module (which
comes with Perl as part of the Standard Library) supports this in the
\&\f(CW\*(C`start_multipart_form()\*(C'\fR method, which isn't the same as the \f(CW\*(C`startform()\*(C'\fR
method.
.PP
See the section in the \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR documentation on file uploads for code
examples and details.
.SS "How do I make an \s-1HTML\s0 pop-up menu with Perl?"
.IX Subsection "How do I make an HTML pop-up menu with Perl?"

.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR module (which comes with Perl) has functions to create
the \s-1HTML\s0 form widgets. See the \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR documentation for more
examples.
.PP
.Vb 3

.SS "How do I fetch an \s-1HTML\s0 file?"
.IX Subsection "How do I fetch an HTML file?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
Use the libwww-perl distribution. The \f(CW\*(C`LWP::Simple\*(C'\fR module can fetch web
resources and give their content back to you as a string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use LWP::Simple qw(get);
\&
\&        my $html = get( "http://www.example.com/index.html" );
.Ve
.PP
It can also store the resource directly in a file:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use LWP::Simple qw(getstore);
\&
\&        getstore( "http://www.example.com/index.html", "foo.html" );
.Ve
.PP
If you need to do something more complicated, you can use
\&\f(CW\*(C`LWP::UserAgent\*(C'\fR module to create your own user-agent (e.g. browser)
to get the job done. If you want to simulate an interactive web
browser, you can use the \f(CW\*(C`WWW::Mechanize\*(C'\fR module.
.SS "How do I automate an \s-1HTML\s0 form submission?"
.IX Subsection "How do I automate an HTML form submission?"
If you are doing something complex, such as moving through many pages
and forms or a web site, you can use \f(CW\*(C`WWW::Mechanize\*(C'\fR.  See its
documentation for all the details.
.PP
If you're submitting values using the \s-1GET\s0 method, create a \s-1URL\s0 and encode
the form using the \f(CW\*(C`query_form\*(C'\fR method:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        use LWP::Simple;
\&        use URI::URL;
\&
\&        my $url = url(\*(Aqhttp://www.perl.com/cgi\-bin/cpan_mod\*(Aq);
\&        $url\->query_form(module => \*(AqDB_File\*(Aq, readme => 1);
\&        $content = get($url);
.Ve
.PP
If you're using the \s-1POST\s0 method, create your own user agent and encode
the content appropriately.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        use HTTP::Request::Common qw(POST);
\&        use LWP::UserAgent;
\&
\&        $ua = LWP::UserAgent\->new();
\&        my $req = POST \*(Aqhttp://www.perl.com/cgi\-bin/cpan_mod\*(Aq,
\&                                   [ module => \*(AqDB_File\*(Aq, readme => 1 ];

.SS "How do I decode or create those %\-encodings on the web?"
.IX Xref "URI CGI.pm CGI URI::Escape RFC 2396"
.IX Subsection "How do I decode or create those %-encodings on the web?"
(contributed by brian d foy)
.PP
Those \f(CW\*(C`%\*(C'\fR encodings handle reserved characters in URIs, as described
in \s-1RFC\s0 2396, Section 2. This encoding replaces the reserved character
with the hexadecimal representation of the character's number from
the US-ASCII table. For instance, a colon, \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR, becomes \f(CW%3A\fR.
.PP
In \s-1CGI\s0 scripts, you don't have to worry about decoding URIs if you are
using \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR. You shouldn't have to process the \s-1URI\s0 yourself,
either on the way in or the way out.
.PP
If you have to encode a string yourself, remember that you should
never try to encode an already-composed \s-1URI\s0. You need to escape the
components separately then put them together. To encode a string, you
can use the the \f(CW\*(C`URI::Escape\*(C'\fR module. The \f(CW\*(C`uri_escape\*(C'\fR function
returns the escaped string:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my $original = "Colon : Hash # Percent %";
\&
\&        my $escaped = uri_escape( $original );
\&
\&        print "$escaped\en"; # \*(AqColon%20%3A%20Hash%20%23%20Percent%20%25\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
To decode the string, use the \f(CW\*(C`uri_unescape\*(C'\fR function:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        my $unescaped = uri_unescape( $escaped );
\&
\&        print $unescaped; # back to original
.Ve
.PP
If you wanted to do it yourself, you simply need to replace the
reserved characters with their encodings. A global substitution
is one way to do it:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        # encode
\&        $string =~ s/([^^A\-Za\-z0\-9\e\-_.!~*\*(Aq()])/ sprintf "%%%0x", ord $1 /eg;
\&
\&        #decode
\&        $string =~ s/%([A\-Fa\-f\ed]{2})/chr hex $1/eg;
.Ve
.SS "How do I redirect to another page?"
.IX Subsection "How do I redirect to another page?"
Specify the complete \s-1URL\s0 of the destination (even if it is on the same
server). This is one of the two different kinds of \s-1CGI\s0 \*(L"Location:\*(R"
responses which are defined in the \s-1CGI\s0 specification for a Parsed Headers
script. The other kind (an absolute URLpath) is resolved internally to
the server without any \s-1HTTP\s0 redirection. The \s-1CGI\s0 specifications do not
allow relative URLs in either case.
.PP
Use of \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR is strongly recommended.  This example shows redirection
with a complete \s-1URL\s0. This redirection is handled by the web browser.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use CGI qw/:standard/;
\&
\&        my $url = \*(Aqhttp://www.cpan.org/\*(Aq;
\&        print redirect($url);
.Ve
.PP
This example shows a redirection with an absolute URLpath.  This
redirection is handled by the local web server.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        my $url = \*(Aq/CPAN/index.html\*(Aq;
\&        print redirect($url);
.Ve
.PP
But if coded directly, it could be as follows (the final \*(L"\en\*(R" is
shown separately, for clarity), using either a complete \s-1URL\s0 or
an absolute URLpath.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        print "Location: $url\en";   # CGI response header
\&        print "\en";                 # end of headers
.Ve
.SS "How do I put a password on my web pages?"

To enable authentication for your web server, you need to configure

The \f(CW\*(C`HTTPD::UserAdmin\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`HTTPD::GroupAdmin\*(C'\fR modules provide a

Use the \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR module that comes with Perl.  It's quick,
it's easy, and it actually does quite a bit of work to
ensure things happen correctly.  It handles \s-1GET\s0, \s-1POST\s0, and
\&\s-1HEAD\s0 requests, multipart forms, multivalued fields, query
string and message body combinations, and many other things
you probably don't want to think about.
.PP
It doesn't get much easier: the \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR module automatically
parses the input and makes each value available through the
\&\f(CW\*(C`param()\*(C'\fR function.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use CGI qw(:standard);
\&
\&        my $total = param( \*(Aqprice\*(Aq ) + param( \*(Aqshipping\*(Aq );
\&
\&        my @items = param( \*(Aqitem\*(Aq ); # multiple values, same field name
.Ve
.PP
If you want an object-oriented approach, \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR can do that too.
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        use CGI;
\&
\&        my $cgi = CGI\->new();
\&
\&        my $total = $cgi\->param( \*(Aqprice\*(Aq ) + $cgi\->param( \*(Aqshipping\*(Aq );
\&
\&        my @items = $cgi\->param( \*(Aqitem\*(Aq );
.Ve
.PP
You might also try \f(CW\*(C`CGI::Minimal\*(C'\fR which is a lightweight version
of the same thing.  Other CGI::* modules on \s-1CPAN\s0 might work better
for you, too.
.PP
Many people try to write their own decoder (or copy one from
another program) and then run into one of the many \*(L"gotchas\*(R"
of the task.  It's much easier and less hassle to use \f(CW\*(C`CGI.pm\*(C'\fR.
.SS "How do I check a valid mail address?"
.IX Subsection "How do I check a valid mail address?"
(partly contributed by Aaron Sherman)
.PP
This isn't as simple a question as it sounds.  There are two parts:
.PP
a) How do I verify that an email address is correctly formatted?
.PP
b) How do I verify that an email address targets a valid recipient?
.PP
Without sending mail to the address and seeing whether there's a human
on the other end to answer you, you cannot fully answer part \fIb\fR, but
either the \f(CW\*(C`Email::Valid\*(C'\fR or the \f(CW\*(C`RFC::RFC822::Address\*(C'\fR module will do
both part \fIa\fR and part \fIb\fR as far as you can in real-time.
.PP
If you want to just check part \fIa\fR to see that the address is valid
according to the mail header standard with a simple regular expression,
you can have problems, because there are deliverable addresses that
aren't \s-1RFC\-2822\s0 (the latest mail header standard) compliant, and
addresses that aren't deliverable which, are compliant.  However,  the
following will match valid \s-1RFC\-2822\s0 addresses that do not have comments,
folding whitespace, or any other obsolete or non-essential elements.
This \fIjust\fR matches the address itself:
.PP
.Vb 8
\&        my $atom       = qr{[a\-zA\-Z0\-9_!#\e$\e%&\*(Aq*+/=?\e^\`{}~|\e\-]+};
\&        my $dot_atom   = qr{$atom(?:\e.$atom)*};
\&        my $quoted     = qr{"(?:\e\e[^\er\en]|[^\e\e"])*"};
\&        my $local      = qr{(?:$dot_atom|$quoted)};
\&        my $quotedpair = qr{\e\e[\ex00\-\ex09\ex0B\-\ex0c\ex0e\-\ex7e]};
\&        my $domain_lit = qr{\e[(?:$quotedpair|[\ex21\-\ex5a\ex5e\-\ex7e])*\e]};
\&        my $domain     = qr{(?:$dot_atom|$domain_lit)};
\&        my $addr_spec  = qr{$local\e@$domain};
.Ve
.PP
Just match an address against \f(CW\*(C`/^${addr_spec}$/\*(C'\fR to see if it follows
the \s-1RFC2822\s0 specification.  However, because it is impossible to be
sure that such a correctly formed address is actually the correct way
to reach a particular person or even has a mailbox associated with it,
you must be very careful about how you use this.
.PP
Our best advice for verifying a person's mail address is to have them
enter their address twice, just as you normally do to change a
password. This usually weeds out typos. If both versions match, send
mail to that address with a personal message. If you get the message
back and they've followed your directions, you can be reasonably
assured that it's real.
.PP
A related strategy that's less open to forgery is to give them a \s-1PIN\s0
(personal \s-1ID\s0 number).  Record the address and \s-1PIN\s0 (best that it be a
random one) for later processing. In the mail you send, ask them to
include the \s-1PIN\s0 in their reply.  But if it bounces, or the message is
included via a \*(L"vacation\*(R" script, it'll be there anyway.  So it's
best to ask them to mail back a slight alteration of the \s-1PIN\s0, such as
with the characters reversed, one added or subtracted to each digit, etc.
.SS "How do I decode a \s-1MIME/BASE64\s0 string?"
.IX Subsection "How do I decode a MIME/BASE64 string?"
The \f(CW\*(C`MIME\-Base64\*(C'\fR package (available from \s-1CPAN\s0) handles this as well as
the \s-1MIME/QP\s0 encoding.  Decoding \s-1BASE64\s0 becomes as simple as:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        use MIME::Base64;
\&        $decoded = decode_base64($encoded);
.Ve
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`MIME\-Tools\*(C'\fR package (available from \s-1CPAN\s0) supports extraction with
decoding of \s-1BASE64\s0 encoded attachments and content directly from email
messages.
.PP
If the string to decode is short (less than 84 bytes long)
a more direct approach is to use the \f(CW\*(C`unpack()\*(C'\fR function's \*(L"u\*(R"
format after minor transliterations:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&        tr#A\-Za\-z0\-9+/##cd;                   # remove non\-base64 chars
\&        tr#A\-Za\-z0\-9+/# \-_#;                  # convert to uuencoded format
\&        $len = pack("c", 32 + 0.75*length);   # compute length byte
\&        print unpack("u", $len . $_);         # uudecode and print
.Ve
.SS "How do I return the user's mail address?"
.IX Subsection "How do I return the user's mail address?"
On systems that support getpwuid, the \f(CW$<\fR variable, and the
\&\f(CW\*(C`Sys::Hostname\*(C'\fR module (which is part of the standard perl distribution),
you can probably try using something like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&        use Sys::Hostname;
\&        $address = sprintf(\*(Aq%s@%s\*(Aq, scalar getpwuid($<), hostname);
.Ve
.PP
Company policies on mail address can mean that this generates addresses
that the company's mail system will not accept, so you should ask for
users' mail addresses when this matters.  Furthermore, not all systems
on which Perl runs are so forthcoming with this information as is Unix.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`Mail::Util\*(C'\fR module from \s-1CPAN\s0 (part of the \f(CW\*(C`MailTools\*(C'\fR package) provides a
\&\f(CW\*(C`mailaddress()\*(C'\fR function that tries to guess the mail address of the user.
It makes a more intelligent guess than the code above, using information
given when the module was installed, but it could still be incorrect.
Again, the best way is often just to ask the user.
.SS "How do I send mail?"
.IX Subsection "How do I send mail?"
Use the \f(CW\*(C`sendmail\*(C'\fR program directly:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&        open(SENDMAIL, "|/usr/lib/sendmail \-oi \-t \-odq")
\&                or die "Can\*(Aqt fork for sendmail: $!\en";
\&        print SENDMAIL <<"EOF";
\&        From: User Originating Mail <me\e@host>
\&        To: Final Destination <you\e@otherhost>
\&        Subject: A relevant subject line
\&
\&        Body of the message goes here after the blank line
\&        in as many lines as you like.
\&        EOF
\&        close(SENDMAIL)     or warn "sendmail didn\*(Aqt close nicely";
.Ve
.PP
The \fB\-oi\fR option prevents \f(CW\*(C`sendmail\*(C'\fR from interpreting a line consisting
of a single dot as \*(L"end of message\*(R".  The \fB\-t\fR option says to use the
headers to decide who to send the message to, and \fB\-odq\fR says to put
the message into the queue.  This last option means your message won't
be immediately delivered, so leave it out if you want immediate
delivery.
.PP
Alternate, less convenient approaches include calling \f(CW\*(C`mail\*(C'\fR (sometimes
called \f(CW\*(C`mailx\*(C'\fR) directly or simply opening up port 25 have having an
intimate conversation between just you and the remote \s-1SMTP\s0 daemon,
probably \f(CW\*(C`sendmail\*(C'\fR.
