.SH "NAME"
perl5112delta \- what is new for perl v5.11.2
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.11.1 release and the
5.11.2 release.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "qr overloading"
.IX Subsection "qr overloading"
It is now possible to overload the \f(CW\*(C`qr//\*(C'\fR operator, that is,
conversion to regexp, like it was already possible to overload
conversion to boolean, string or number of objects. It is invoked when
an object appears on the right hand side of the \f(CW\*(C`=~\*(C'\fR operator, or when
it is interpolated into a regexp. See overload.
.SS "Pluggable keywords"
.IX Subsection "Pluggable keywords"
Extension modules can now cleanly hook into the Perl parser to define
new kinds of keyword-headed expression and compound statement. The
syntax following the keyword is defined entirely by the extension. This
allow a completely non-Perl sublanguage to be parsed inline, with the
right ops cleanly generated. This feature is currently considered
experimental.
.PP
See \*(L"PL_keyword_plugin\*(R" in perlapi for the mechanism. The Perl core
source distribution also includes a new module
XS::APItest::KeywordRPN, which implements reverse Polish notation
arithmetic via pluggable keywords. This module is mainly used for test
purposes, and is not normally installed, but also serves as an example
of how to use the new mechanism.
.SS "APIs for more internals"
.IX Subsection "APIs for more internals"
The lowest layers of the lexer and parts of the pad system now have C
APIs available to \s-1XS\s0 extensions. These are necessary to support proper
use of pluggable keywords, but have other uses too. The new APIs are
experimental, and only cover a small proportion of what would be
necessary to take full advantage of the core's facilities in these
areas. It is intended that the Perl 5.13 development cycle will see the
addition of a full range of clean, supported interfaces.
.SS "Overridable function lookup"
.IX Subsection "Overridable function lookup"
Where an extension module hooks the creation of rv2cv ops to modify the
subroutine lookup process, this now works correctly for bareword
subroutine calls. This means that prototypes on subroutines referenced
this way will be processed correctly. (Previously bareword subroutine
names were initially looked up, for parsing purposes, by an unhookable
mechanism, so extensions could only properly influence subroutine names
that appeared with an \f(CW\*(C`&\*(C'\fR sigil.)

The following items are now deprecated.
.ie n .SS "Use of "":="" to mean an empty attribute list is now deprecated."
.el .SS "Use of \f(CW:=\fP to mean an empty attribute list is now deprecated."
.IX Subsection "Use of := to mean an empty attribute list is now deprecated."
An accident of Perl's parser meant that these constructions were all
equivalent:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    my $pi := 4;
\&    my $pi : = 4;
\&    my $pi :  = 4;
.Ve
.PP
with the \f(CW\*(C`:\*(C'\fR being treated as the start of an attribute list, which
ends before the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR. As whitespace is not significant here, all are
parsed as an empty attribute list, hence all the above are equivalent
to, and better written as
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    my $pi = 4;
.Ve
.PP
because no attribute processing is done for an empty list.
.PP
As is, this meant that \f(CW\*(C`:=\*(C'\fR cannot be used as a new token, without
silently changing the meaning of existing code. Hence that particular
form is now deprecated, and will become a syntax error. If it is
absolutely necessary to have empty attribute lists (for example,
because of a code generator) then avoid the warning by adding a space
before the \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR.

If you find what you think is a bug, you might check the articles
recently posted to the comp.lang.perl.misc newsgroup and the perl bug
database at http://rt.perl.org/perlbug/ . There may also be information
at http://www.perl.org/ , the Perl Home Page.
.PP
If you believe you have an unreported bug, please run the \fBperlbug\fR
program included with your release. Be sure to trim your bug down to a
tiny but sufficient test case. Your bug report, along with the output
of \f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR, will be sent off to perlbug@perl.org to be analysed by
the Perl porting team.
.PP
If the bug you are reporting has security implications, which make it
inappropriate to send to a publicly archived mailing list, then please
send it to perl5\-security\-report@perl.org. This points to a closed
subscription unarchived mailing list, which includes all the core
committers, who be able to help assess the impact of issues, figure out
a resolution, and help co-ordinate the release of patches to mitigate
or fix the problem across all platforms on which Perl is supported.
Please only use this address for security issues in the Perl core, not
