See the section `Precommand Modifiers\&'\&.
.TP
\fB\&.\fP \fIfile\fP [ \fIarg\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
Read commands from \fIfile\fP and execute them in the current shell
environment\&.
.RS
.PP
If \fIfile\fP does not contain a slash, or if \fBPATH_DIRS\fP is set,
the shell looks in the components of \fB$path\fP to find the directory
containing \fIfile\fP\&.  Files in the current directory are not read
unless `\fB\&.\fP\&' appears somewhere in \fB$path\fP\&.  If a file named
`\fIfile\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP\&' is found, is newer than \fIfile\fP, and is the
compiled form (created with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin) of \fIfile\fP,
then commands are read from that file instead of \fIfile\fP\&.
.PP
If any arguments \fIarg\fP are given,
they become the positional parameters; the old positional
parameters are restored when the \fIfile\fP is done executing\&.
If \fIfile\fP was not found the return status is 127; if \fIfile\fP was found
but contained a syntax error the return status is 126; else the return
status is the exit status of the last command executed\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB:\fP [ \fIarg\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This command does nothing, although normal argument expansions is performed
which may have effects on shell parameters\&.  A zero exit status is returned\&.
.TP
\fBalias\fP [ {\fB+|\fB\-\fP\fP}\fBgmrsL\fP ] [ \fIname\fP[\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP] \&.\&.\&. ]
For each \fIname\fP with a corresponding \fIvalue\fP, define an alias
with that value\&.  A trailing space in \fIvalue\fP causes the next word
to be checked for alias expansion\&.  If the \fB\-g\fP flag is present,
define a global alias; global aliases are expanded even if they do not
occur in command position\&.
.RS
.PP
If the \fB\-s\fP flags is present, define a suffix alias: if the command
word on a command line is in the form `\fItext\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIname\fP\&', where
\fItext\fP is any non\-empty string, it is replaced by the text
`\fIvalue\fP \fItext\fP\fB\&.\fP\fIname\fP\&'\&.  Note that \fIname\fP is treated as
a literal string, not a pattern\&.  A trailing space in \fIvalue\fP is not
special in this case\&.  For example,
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBalias \-s ps=gv\fP

.RE
.PP
will cause the command `\fB*\&.ps\fP\&' to be expanded to `\fBgv *\&.ps\fP'\&.  As
alias expansion is carried out earlier than globbing, the `\fB*\&.ps\fP\&' will
then be expanded\&.  Suffix aliases constitute a different name space from
other aliases (so in the above example it is still possible
to create an alias for the command \fBps\fP) and the two sets are never
listed together\&.
.PP
For each \fIname\fP with no \fIvalue\fP,
print the value of \fIname\fP, if any\&.  With no arguments, print all
currently defined aliases other than suffix aliases\&.  If the \fB\-m\fP flag
is given the arguments are taken as patterns (they should be quoted to
preserve them from being interpreted as glob patterns), and the aliases
matching these patterns are printed\&.  When printing aliases and one of
the \fB\-g\fP, \fB\-r\fP or \fB\-s\fP flags is present, restrict the printing to
global, regular or suffix aliases, respectively; a regular alias is one
which is neither a global nor a suffix alias\&.   Using `\fB+\fP\&'
instead of `\fB\-\fP\&', or ending the option list with a single
`\fB+\fP\&', prevents the values of the aliases from being printed\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-L\fP flag is present, then print each
alias in a manner suitable for putting in a startup script\&.  The exit
status is nonzero if a \fIname\fP (with no \fIvalue\fP) is given for
which no alias has been defined\&.
.PP

\fBautoload\fP [ {\fB+\fP|\fB\-\fP}\fBUXkmtz\fP ] [ \fB\-w\fP ] [ \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
Equivalent to \fBfunctions \-u\fP, with the exception of \fB\-X\fP/\fB+X\fP and
\fB\-w\fP\&.
.RS
.PP
The flag \fB\-X\fP may be used only inside a shell function, and may not be
followed by a \fIname\fP\&.  It causes the calling function to be marked for
autoloading and then immediately loaded and executed, with the current
array of positional parameters as arguments\&.  This replaces the previous
definition of the function\&.  If no function definition is found, an error
is printed and the function remains undefined and marked for autoloading\&.
.PP
The flag \fB+X\fP attempts to load each \fIname\fP as an autoloaded function,
but does \fInot\fP execute it\&.  The exit status is zero (success) if the
function was not previously defined \fIand\fP a definition for it was found\&.
This does \fInot\fP replace any existing definition of the function\&.  The
exit status is nonzero (failure) if the function was already defined or
when no definition was found\&.  In the latter case the function remains
undefined and marked for autoloading\&.  If ksh\-style autoloading is
enabled, the function created will contain the contents of the file
plus a call to the function itself appended to it, thus giving normal
ksh autoloading behaviour on the first call to the function\&.
If the \fB\-m\fP flag is also given each \fIname\fP is treated as a
pattern and all functions already marked for autoload that match the
pattern are loaded\&.
.PP
With the \fB\-w\fP flag, the \fIname\fPs are taken as names of files compiled
with the \fBzcompile\fP builtin, and all functions defined in them are
marked for autoloading\&.
.PP
The flags \fB\-z\fP and \fB\-k\fP mark the function to be autoloaded using the
zsh or ksh style, as if the option \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP were unset or were
set, respectively\&.  The flags override the setting of the option at the
time the function is loaded\&.
.PP
Note that the \fBautoload\fP command makes no attempt to ensure the
shell options set during the loading or execution of the file have
any particular value\&.  For this, the \fBemulate\fP command can be used:
.PP
.RS
.nf

Change the current directory\&.  In the first form, change the
current directory to \fIarg\fP, or to the value of \fB$HOME\fP if
\fIarg\fP is not specified\&.  If \fIarg\fP is `\fB\-\fP\&', change to the
previous directory\&.
.RS
.PP
Otherwise, if \fIarg\fP begins with a slash, attempt to change to the
directory given by \fIarg\fP\&.
.PP
If \fIarg\fP does not begin with a slash, the behaviour depends on whether
the current directory `\fB\&.\fP\&' occurs in the list of directories contained
in the shell parameter \fBcdpath\fP\&.  If it does not, first attempt to change
to the directory \fIarg\fP under the current directory, and if that fails
but \fBcdpath\fP is set and contains at least one element attempt to change
to the directory \fIarg\fP under each component of \fBcdpath\fP in turn until
successful\&.  If `\fB\&.\fP\&' occurs in \fBcdpath\fP, then \fBcdpath\fP is searched
strictly in order so that `\fB\&.\fP\&' is only tried at the appropriate point\&.
.PP
The order of testing \fBcdpath\fP is modified if the option \fBPOSIX_CD\fP
is set, as described in the documentation for the option\&.
.PP
If no directory is found, the option \fBCDABLE_VARS\fP is set, and a
parameter named \fIarg\fP exists whose value begins with a slash, treat its
value as the directory\&.  In that case, the parameter is added to the named
directory hash table\&.
.PP
The second form of \fBcd\fP substitutes the string \fInew\fP
for the string \fIold\fP in the name of the current directory,
and tries to change to this new directory\&.
.PP
The third form of \fBcd\fP extracts an entry from the directory
stack, and changes to that directory\&.  An argument of the form
`\fB+\fP\fIn\fP\&' identifies a stack entry by counting from the left
of the list shown by the \fBdirs\fP command, starting with zero\&.
An argument of the form `\fB\-\fP\fIn\fP\&' counts from the right\&.
If the \fBPUSHD_MINUS\fP option is set, the meanings of `\fB+\fP\&'
and `\fB\-\fP\&' in this context are swapped\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-q\fP (quiet) option is specified, the hook function \fBchpwd\fP
and the functions in the array \fBchpwd_functions\fP are not called\&.
This is useful for calls to \fBcd\fP that do not change the environment
seen by an interactive user\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-s\fP option is specified, \fBcd\fP refuses to change the current
directory if the given pathname contains symlinks\&.  If the \fB\-P\fP option
is given or the \fBCHASE_LINKS\fP option is set, symbolic links are resolved
to their true values\&.  If the \fB\-L\fP option is given symbolic links are
retained in the directory (and not resolved) regardless of the state of
the \fBCHASE_LINKS\fP option\&.

\fBcommand\fP [ \fB\-pvV\fP ] \fIsimple command\fP
The simple command argument is taken as an external command instead of
a function or builtin and is executed\&. If the \fBPOSIX_BUILTINS\fP option
is set, builtins will also be executed but certain special properties
of them are suppressed\&. The \fB\-p\fP flag causes a default path to be
searched instead of that in \fB$path\fP\&. With the \fB\-v\fP flag, \fBcommand\fP
is similar to \fBwhence\fP and with \fB\-V\fP, it is equivalent to \fBwhence

\fBdisable\fP [ \fB\-afmrs\fP ] \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&.
Temporarily disable the \fIname\fPd hash table elements\&.  The default
is to disable builtin commands\&.  This allows you to use an external
command with the same name as a builtin command\&.  The \fB\-a\fP option
causes \fBdisable\fP to act on regular or global aliases\&.  The \fB\-s\fP

\fBdisable\fP to act on shell functions\&.  The \fB\-r\fP options causes
\fBdisable\fP to act on reserved words\&.  Without arguments all disabled
hash table elements from the corresponding hash table are printed\&.
With the \fB\-m\fP flag the arguments are taken as patterns (which should be

\fBemulate\fP [ \fB\-LR\fP ] [ {\fBzsh\fP|\fBsh\fP|\fBksh\fP|\fBcsh\fP} [ \fIflags\fP \&.\&.\&. ] ]
Without any argument print current emulation mode\&.
.RS
.PP
With single argument set up zsh options to emulate the specified shell
as much as possible\&.
\fBcsh\fP will never be fully emulated\&.
If the argument is not one of the shells listed above, \fBzsh\fP
will be used as a default; more precisely, the tests performed on the
argument are the same as those used to determine the emulation at startup
based on the shell name, see
the section COMPATIBILITY in \fIzsh\fP(1)
\&.
.PP
If the \fBemulate\fP command occurs inside a function that has been
marked for execution tracing with \fBfunctions \-t\fP then the \fBxtrace\fP
option will be turned on regardless of emulation mode or other options\&.
Note that code executed inside the function by the \fB\&.\fP, \fBsource\fP, or
\fBeval\fP commands is not considered to be running directly from the
function, hence does not provoke this behaviour\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-R\fP switch is given, all settable options
are reset to their default value corresponding to the specified emulation
mode, except for certain options describing the interactive
environment; otherwise, only those options likely to cause portability
problems in scripts and functions are altered\&.  If the \fB\-L\fP switch is given,
the options \fBLOCAL_OPTIONS\fP and \fBLOCAL_TRAPS\fP will be set as
well, causing the effects of the \fBemulate\fP command and any \fBsetopt\fP and
\fBtrap\fP commands to be local to the immediately surrounding shell
function, if any; normally these options are turned off in all emulation
modes except \fBksh\fP\&. The \fB\-L\fP switch is mutually exclusive with the
use of \fB\-c\fP in \fIflags\fP\&.
.PP
The \fIflags\fP may be any of the invocation\-time flags described in
the section INVOCATION in \fIzsh\fP(1),
except that `\fB\-o EMACS\fP\&' and `\fB\-o VI\fP' may not be used\&.  Flags such
as `\fB+r\fP\&'/`\fB+o RESTRICTED\fP' may be prohibited in some circumstances\&.
.PP
If \fB\-c\fP \fIarg\fP appears in \fIflags\fP, \fIarg\fP is evaluated while the
requested emulation is temporarily in effect\&.  In this case the emulation
mode and all options are restored to their previous values before
\fBemulate\fP returns\&.  The \fB\-R\fP switch may precede the name of the shell
to emulate; note this has a meaning distinct from including \fB\-R\fP in
\fIflags\fP\&.
.PP
Use of \fB\-c\fP enables `sticky\&' emulation mode for functions defined
within the evaluated expression:  the emulation mode is associated
thereafter with the function so that whenever the function is executed
the emulation (respecting the \fB\-R\fP switch, if present) and all
options are set before entry to the function, and restored after exit\&.
If the function is called when the sticky emulation is already in
effect, either within an `\fBemulate\fP \fIshell\fP \fB\-c\fP\&' expression or
within another function with the same sticky emulation, entry and exit
from the function do not cause options to be altered (except due to
standard processing such as the \fBLOCAL_OPTIONS\fP option)\&.  This also
applies to functions marked for autoload within the sticky emulation;
the appropriate set of options will be applied at the point the
function is loaded as well as when it is run\&.
.PP
For example:
.PP
.RS
.nf
\fBemulate sh \-c \&'fni() { setopt cshnullglob; }
fno() { fni; }\&'
fno
\fP
.fi
.RE
.PP
The two functions \fBfni\fP and \fBfno\fP are defined with sticky \fBsh\fP
emulation\&.  \fBfno\fP is then executed, causing options associated
with emulations to be set to their values in \fBsh\fP\&.  \fBfni\fP then
calls \fBfno\fP; because \fBfno\fP is also marked for sticky \fBsh\fP
emulation, no option changes take place on entry to or exit from it\&.
Hence the option \fBcshnullglob\fP, turned off by \fBsh\fP emulation, will
be turned on within \fBfni\fP and remain on on return to \fBfno\fP\&.  On exit
from \fBfno\fP, the emulation mode and all options will be restored to the
state they were in before entry to the temporary emulation\&.
.PP
The documentation above is typically sufficient for the intended
purpose of executing code designed for other shells in a suitable
environment\&.  More detailed rules follow\&.
.PD 0
.TP
1\&.
The sticky emulation environment provided by `\fBemulate\fP
\fIshell\fP \fB\-c\fP\&' is identical to that provided by entry to
a function marked for sticky emulation as a consequence of being
defined in such an environment\&.  Hence, for example, the sticky
emulation is inherited by subfunctions defined within functions
with sticky emulation\&.
.TP
2\&.
No change of options takes place on entry to or exit from
functions that are not marked for sticky emulation, other than those
that would normally take place, even if those functions are called
within sticky emulation\&.
.TP
3\&.
No special handling is provided for functions marked for
\fBautoload\fP nor for functions present in wordcode created by
the \fBzcompile\fP command\&.
.TP
4\&.
The presence or absence of the \fB\-R\fP switch to \fBemulate\fP
corresponds to different sticky emulation modes, so for example
`\fBemulate sh \-c\fP\&', `\fBemulate \-R sh \-c\fP' and `\fBemulate csh \-c\fP'
are treated as three distinct sticky emulations\&.
.TP
5\&.
Difference in shell options supplied in addition to the
basic emulation also mean the sticky emulations are different, so for
example `\fBemulate zsh \-c\fP\&' and `\fBemulate zsh \-o cbases \-c\fP' are
treated as distinct sticky emulations\&.

\fB$HISTFILE\fP is unset, and \fB$HISTSIZE\fP & \fB$SAVEHIST\fP are set to their
default values\&.  If one argument is given, \fB$HISTFILE\fP is set to that

file is read in (if it exists) to initialize the new list\&.  If a second

change these environment values for the new history list however you desire

`\fBfc \-P\fP\&' pops the history list back to an older list saved by `\fBfc \-p\fP'\&.
The current list is saved to its \fB$HISTFILE\fP before it is destroyed

course)\&.  The values of \fB$HISTFILE\fP, \fB$HISTSIZE\fP, and \fB$SAVEHIST\fP are
restored to the values they had when `\fBfc \-p\fP\&' was called\&.  Note that this
restoration can conflict with making these variables "local", so your best
bet is to avoid local declarations for these variables in functions that use
`\fBfc \-p\fP\&'\&.  The one other guaranteed\-safe combination is declaring these
variables to be local at the top of your function and using the automatic
option (\fB\-a\fP) with `\fBfc \-p\fP\&'\&.  Finally, note that it is legal to manually
pop a push marked for automatic popping if you need to do so before the

`\fBfc \-R\fP\&' reads the history from the given file,

By default the function is implemented by a shell function of the same

\fBFUNCTION_ARGZERO\fP is in effect\&.  The positional parameters in the shell
function correspond to the arguments of the mathematical function call\&.

Checks the \fIarg\fPs for legal options\&.  If the \fIarg\fPs are omitted,

begins with a `\fB+\fP\&' or a `\fB\-\fP'\&.  An argument not beginning with
a `\fB+\fP\&' or a `\fB\-\fP', or the argument `\fB\-\fP\fB\-\fP', ends the options\&.
Note that a single `\fB\-\fP\&' is not considered a valid option argument\&.
\fIoptstring\fP contains the letters that \fBgetopts\fP

Each time it is invoked, \fBgetopts\fP places the option letter it finds

The first option to be examined may be changed by explicitly assigning

unset, it remains unset, and the index or option argument is not
stored\&.  The option itself is still stored in \fIname\fP in this case\&.

A leading `\fB:\fP\&' in \fIoptstring\fP causes \fBgetopts\fP to store the
letter of any invalid option in \fBOPTARG\fP, and to set \fIname\fP to

\fBprintf\fP \fIformat\fP [ \fIarg\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
Print the arguments according to the format specification\&. Formatting
rules are the same as used in C\&. The same escape sequences as for \fBecho\fP
are recognised in the format\&. All C conversion specifications ending in
one of csdiouxXeEfgGn are handled\&. In addition to this, `\fB%b\fP\&' can be
used instead of `\fB%s\fP\&' to cause escape sequences in the argument to be
recognised and `\fB%q\fP\&' can be used to quote the argument in such a way
that allows it to be reused as shell input\&. With the numeric format
specifiers, if the corresponding argument starts with a quote character,
the numeric value of the following character is used as the number to
print otherwise the argument is evaluated as an arithmetic expression\&. See
the section `Arithmetic Evaluation\&' in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)

expressions\&. With `\fB%n\fP\&', the corresponding argument is taken as an
identifier which is created as an integer parameter\&.

Normally, conversion specifications are applied to each argument in order

replacing `\fB%\fP\&' by `\fB%\fP\fIn\fP\fB$\fP' and `\fB*\fP' by `\fB*\fP\fIn\fP\fB$\fP'\&.
It is recommended that you do not mix references of this explicit style

If arguments remain unused after formatting, the format string is reused

the scalar and the array may otherwise be manipulated as normal\&.  If one is
unset, the other will automatically be unset too\&.  There is no way of
untying the variables without unsetting them, or converting the type of one
of them with another \fBtypeset\fP command; \fB+T\fP does not work, assigning
an array to \fISCALAR\fP is an error, and assigning a scalar to \fIarray\fP
sets it to be a single\-element array\&.  Note that both `\fBtypeset \-xT \&.\&.\&.\fP\&'
and `\fBexport \-T \&.\&.\&.\fP\&' work, but only the scalar will be marked for
export\&.  Setting the value using the scalar version causes a split on all
separators (which cannot be quoted)\&.  It is possible to use the
same two tied variables with a different separator character in which
case the variables remain joined as before but the separator is changed\&.
This flag has a different meaning when used with \fB\-f\fP; see below\&.
.PP
The \fB\-g\fP (global) flag is treated specially: it means that any
resulting parameter will not be restricted to local scope\&.  Note that this
does not necessarily mean that the parameter will be global, as the flag
will apply to any existing parameter (even if unset) from an enclosing
function\&.  This flag does not affect the parameter after creation, hence it
has no effect when listing existing parameters, nor does the flag \fB+g\fP
have any effect except in combination with \fB\-m\fP (see below)\&.
.PP
If no \fIname\fP is present, the names and values of all parameters are
printed\&.  In this case the attribute flags restrict the display to only
those parameters that have the specified attributes, and using `\fB+\fP\&'
rather than `\fB\-\fP\&' to introduce the flag suppresses printing of the values
of parameters when there is no parameter name\&.  Also, if the last option
is the word `\fB+\fP\&', then names are printed but values are not\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-m\fP flag is given the \fIname\fP arguments are taken as patterns
(which should be quoted)\&.  With no attribute flags, all parameters (or
functions with the \fB\-f\fP flag) with matching names are printed (the shell
option \fBTYPESET_SILENT\fP is not used in this case)\&.  Note that \fB\-m\fP is
ignored if no patterns are given\&.  If the \fB+g\fP flag is combined with
\fB\-m\fP, a new local parameter is created for every matching parameter that
is not already local\&.  Otherwise \fB\-m\fP applies all other flags or
assignments to the existing parameters\&.  Except when assignments are made
with \fIname\fP\fB=\fP\fIvalue\fP, using \fB+m\fP forces the matching parameters
to be printed, even inside a function\&.
.PP
If no attribute flags are given and either no \fB\-m\fP flag is present or
the \fB+m\fP form was used, each parameter name printed is preceded by a
list of the attributes of that parameter (\fBarray\fP, \fBassociation\fP,
\fBexported\fP, \fBinteger\fP, \fBreadonly\fP)\&.  If \fB+m\fP is used with attribute
flags, and all those flags are introduced with \fB+\fP, the matching
parameter names are printed but their values are not\&.
.PP
Attribute flags that transform the final value (\fB\-L\fP, \fB\-R\fP, \fB\-Z\fP,
\fB\-l\fP, \fBu\fP) are only applied to the expanded value at the point
of a parameter expansion expression using `\fB$\fP\&'\&.  They are not applied
when a parameter is retrieved internally by the shell for any purpose\&. 
.PP
The following attribute flags may be specified:
.PP
.PD 0
.TP
.PD
\fB\-A\fP
The names refer to associative array parameters; see
`Array Parameters\&' in \fIzshparam\fP(1)\&.
.TP
\fB\-L\fP
Left justify and remove leading blanks from \fIvalue\fP\&.
If \fIn\fP is nonzero, it defines the width of the field\&.
If \fIn\fP is zero, the width is determined by the width of the value of
the first assignment\&.  In the case of numeric parameters, the length of the
complete value assigned to the parameter is used to determine the width,
not the value that would be output\&.
.RS
.PP
The width is the count of characters, which may be multibyte characters
if the \fBMULTIBYTE\fP option is in effect\&.  Note that the screen
width of the character is not taken into account; if this is required,
use padding with parameter expansion flags
\fB${(ml\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB)\fP\fI\&.\&.\&.\fP\fB}\fP as described in
`Parameter Expansion Flags\&' in
\fIzshexpn\fP(1)\&.
.PP
When the parameter is expanded, it is filled on the right with
blanks or truncated if necessary to fit the field\&.
Note truncation can lead to unexpected results with numeric parameters\&.
Leading zeros are removed if the \fB\-Z\fP flag is also set\&.
.RE
.TP
\fB\-R\fP
Similar to \fB\-L\fP, except that right justification is used;
when the parameter is expanded, the field is left filled with
blanks or truncated from the end\&.  May not be combined with the \fB\-Z\fP
flag\&.
.TP
\fB\-U\fP
For arrays (but not for associative arrays), keep only the first
occurrence of each duplicated value\&.  This may also be set for
colon\-separated special parameters like \fBPATH\fP or \fBFIGNORE\fP, etc\&.
This flag has a different meaning when used with \fB\-f\fP; see below\&.
.TP
\fB\-Z\fP
Specially handled if set along with the \fB\-L\fP flag\&.
Otherwise, similar to \fB\-R\fP, except that leading zeros are used for
padding instead of blanks if the first non\-blank character is a digit\&.
Numeric parameters are specially handled: they are always eligible
for padding with zeroes, and the zeroes are inserted at an appropriate
place in the output\&.
.TP
\fB\-a\fP
The names refer to array parameters\&.  An array parameter may be
created this way, but it may not be assigned to in the \fBtypeset\fP
statement\&.  When displaying, both normal and associative arrays are
shown\&.
.TP
\fB\-f\fP
The names refer to functions rather than parameters\&.  No assignments
can be made, and the only other valid flags are \fB\-t\fP, \fB\-T\fP, \fB\-k\fP,
\fB\-u\fP, \fB\-U\fP and \fB\-z\fP\&.  The flag \fB\-t\fP turns on execution tracing
for this function; the flag \fB\-T\fP does the same, but turns off tracing
on any function called from the present one, unless that function also
has the \fB\-t\fP or \fB\-T\fP flag\&.  The \fB\-u\fP and \fB\-U\fP flags cause the
function to be marked for autoloading; \fB\-U\fP also causes alias
expansion to be suppressed when the function is loaded\&.  The \fBfpath\fP
parameter will be searched to find the function definition when the
function is first referenced; see the section `Functions\&'\&. The \fB\-k\fP and
\fB\-z\fP flags make the function be loaded using ksh\-style or zsh\-style
autoloading respectively\&. If neither is given, the setting of the
KSH_AUTOLOAD option determines how the function is loaded\&.
.TP
\fB\-h\fP
Hide: only useful for special parameters (those marked `<S>\&' in the table in
\fIzshparam\fP(1)), and for local parameters with the same name as a special parameter,
though harmless for others\&.  A special parameter with this attribute will
not retain its special effect when made local\&.  Thus after `\fBtypeset \-h
PATH\fP\&', a function containing `\fBtypeset PATH\fP' will create an ordinary
local parameter without the usual behaviour of \fBPATH\fP\&.  Alternatively,
the local parameter may itself be given this attribute; hence inside a
function `\fBtypeset \-h PATH\fP\&' creates an ordinary local parameter and the
special \fBPATH\fP parameter is not altered in any way\&.  It is also possible
to create a local parameter using `\fBtypeset +h \fP\fIspecial\fP\&', where the
local copy of \fIspecial\fP will retain its special properties regardless of
having the \fB\-h\fP attribute\&.  Global special parameters loaded from shell
modules (currently those in \fBzsh/mapfile\fP and \fBzsh/parameter\fP) are
automatically given the \fB\-h\fP attribute to avoid name clashes\&.
.TP
\fB\-H\fP
Hide value: specifies that \fBtypeset\fP will not display the value of the
parameter when listing parameters; the display for such parameters is
always as if the `\fB+\fP\&' flag had been given\&.  Use of the parameter is
in other respects normal, and the option does not apply if the parameter is
specified by name, or by pattern with the \fB\-m\fP option\&.  This is on by
default for the parameters in the \fBzsh/parameter\fP and \fBzsh/mapfile\fP
modules\&.  Note, however, that unlike the \fB\-h\fP flag this is also useful
for non\-special parameters\&.
.TP
\fB\-i\fP
Use an internal integer representation\&.  If \fIn\fP is nonzero it
defines the output arithmetic base, otherwise it is determined by the
first assignment\&.  Bases from 2 to 36 inclusive are allowed\&.
.TP
\fB\-E\fP
Use an internal double\-precision floating point representation\&.  On output
the variable will be converted to scientific notation\&.  If \fIn\fP is
nonzero it defines the number of significant figures to display; the
default is ten\&.
.TP
\fB\-F\fP
Use an internal double\-precision floating point representation\&.  On output
the variable will be converted to fixed\-point decimal notation\&.  If \fIn\fP
is nonzero it defines the number of digits to display after the decimal
point; the default is ten\&.
.TP
\fB\-l\fP
Convert the result to lower case whenever the parameter is expanded\&.
The value is \fInot\fP converted when assigned\&.
.TP
\fB\-r\fP
The given \fIname\fPs are marked readonly\&.  Note that if \fIname\fP is a
special parameter, the readonly attribute can be turned on, but cannot then
be turned off\&.
.TP
\fB\-t\fP
Tags the named parameters\&.  Tags have no special meaning to the shell\&.
This flag has a different meaning when used with \fB\-f\fP; see above\&.
.TP
\fB\-u\fP
Convert the result to upper case whenever the parameter is expanded\&.
The value is \fInot\fP converted when assigned\&.
This flag has a different meaning when used with \fB\-f\fP; see above\&.
.TP
\fB\-x\fP
Mark for automatic export to the environment of subsequently
executed commands\&.  If the option \fBGLOBAL_EXPORT\fP is set, this implies
the option \fB\-g\fP, unless \fB+g\fP is also explicitly given; in other words
the parameter is not made local to the enclosing function\&.  This is for
compatibility with previous versions of zsh\&.

\fBzcompile \-t\fP \fIfile\fP [ \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. ]
This builtin command can be used to compile functions or scripts,
storing the compiled form in a file, and to examine files containing
the compiled form\&.  This allows faster autoloading of functions and
execution of scripts by avoiding parsing of the text when the files
are read\&.
.RS
.PP
The first form (without the \fB\-c\fP, \fB\-a\fP or \fB\-t\fP options) creates a
compiled file\&.  If only the \fIfile\fP argument is given, the
output file has the name `\fIfile\fP\fB\&.zwc\fP\&' and will be placed in
the same directory as the \fIfile\fP\&.  The shell will load the compiled
file instead of the normal function file when the function
is autoloaded; see
the section `Autoloading Functions\&' in \fIzshmisc\fP(1)
for a description of how autoloaded functions are searched\&.  The
extension \fB\&.zwc\fP stands for `zsh word code\&'\&.
.PP
If there is at least one \fIname\fP argument, all the named files
are compiled into the output \fIfile\fP given as the first argument\&.  If
\fIfile\fP does not end in \fB\&.zwc\fP, this extension is automatically
appended\&.  Files containing multiple compiled functions are called `digest\&'
files, and are intended to be used as elements of the \fBFPATH\fP/\fBfpath\fP
special array\&.
.PP
The second form, with the \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP options, writes the compiled
definitions for all the named functions into \fIfile\fP\&.  For \fB\-c\fP, the
names must be functions currently defined in the shell, not those marked
for autoloading\&.  Undefined functions that are marked for autoloading
may be written by using the \fB\-a\fP option, in which case the \fBfpath\fP
is searched and the contents of the definition files for those
functions, if found, are compiled into \fIfile\fP\&.  If both \fB\-c\fP and
\fB\-a\fP are given, names of both defined functions and functions marked
for autoloading may be given\&.  In either case, the functions in files
written with the \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP option will be autoloaded as if the
\fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option were unset\&.
.PP
The reason for handling loaded and not\-yet\-loaded functions with
different options is that some definition files for autoloading define
multiple functions, including the function with the same name as the
file, and, at the end, call that function\&.  In such cases the output of
`\fBzcompile \-c\fP\&' does not include the additional functions defined in
the file, and any other initialization code in the file is lost\&.  Using
`\fBzcompile \-a\fP\&' captures all this extra information\&.
.PP
If the \fB\-m\fP option is combined with \fB\-c\fP or \fB\-a\fP,
the \fIname\fPs are used as patterns and all functions whose names
match one of these patterns will be written\&. If no \fIname\fP is given,
the definitions of all functions currently defined or marked as
autoloaded will be written\&.
.PP
The third form, with the \fB\-t\fP option, examines an existing
compiled file\&.  Without further arguments, the names of the original
files compiled into it are listed\&.  The first line of output shows
the version of the shell which compiled the file and how the file
will be used (i\&.e\&. by reading it directly or by mapping it into memory)\&.
With arguments, nothing is output and the return status is set to zero if
definitions for \fIall\fP \fIname\fPs were found in the compiled
file, and non\-zero if the definition for at least one \fIname\fP was not
found\&.

When compiling scripts instead of autoloadable functions, it is

.RE
.TP
\fB\-M\fP
The compiled file is mapped into the shell\&'s memory when read\&. This
is done in such a way that multiple instances of the shell running
on the same host will share this mapped file\&.  If neither \fB\-R\fP nor
\fB\-M\fP is given, the \fBzcompile\fP builtin decides what to do based
on the size of the compiled file\&.
.TP
.PD 0
\fB\-k\fP
.TP
.PD
\fB\-z\fP
These options are used when the compiled file contains functions which
are to be autoloaded\&. If \fB\-z\fP is given, the
function will be autoloaded as if the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option is
\fInot\fP set, even if it is set at the time the compiled file is
read, while if the \fB\-k\fP is given, the function will be loaded as if
\fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP \fIis\fP set\&.  These options also take precedence over
any \fB\-k\fP or \fB\-z\fP options specified to the \fBautoload\fP builtin\&. If
neither of these options is given, the function will be loaded as
determined by the setting of the \fBKSH_AUTOLOAD\fP option at the time
the compiled file is read\&.
 
These options may also appear as many times as necessary between the listed
\fIname\fPs to specify the loading style of all following functions, up to
the next \fB\-k\fP or \fB\-z\fP\&.

The created file always contains two versions of the compiled
format, one for big\-endian machines and one for small\-endian
machines\&.  The upshot of this is that the compiled file is machine
independent and if it is read or mapped, only one half of the file
is actually used (and mapped)\&.

available on all operating systems, or on all installations on a particular
operating system, although the \fBzmodload\fP command itself is always
available and can be used to manipulate modules built into versions of the
shell executable without dynamical loading\&.
.RS
.PP
Without arguments the names of all currently loaded binary modules are
printed\&.  The \fB\-L\fP option causes this list to be in the form of a
series of \fBzmodload\fP commands\&.  Forms with arguments are:

\fBzmodload\fP [ \fB\-i\fP ] \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&. 
.TP
.PD
\fBzmodload\fP \fB\-u\fP [ \fB\-i\fP ] \fIname\fP \&.\&.\&.
In the simplest case, \fBzmodload\fP loads a binary module\&.  The module must
be in a file with a name consisting of the specified \fIname\fP followed by
a standard suffix, usually `\fB\&.so\fP\&' (`\fB\&.sl\fP' on HPUX)\&.
If the module to be loaded is already loaded the duplicate module is
ignored\&.  If \fBzmodload\fP detects an inconsistency, such as an
invalid module name or circular dependency list, the current code block is 
aborted\&.   Hence `\fBzmodload\fP \fImodule\fP \fB2>/dev/null\fP\&' is sufficient
to test whether a module is available\&.
If it is available, the module is loaded if necessary, while if it
is not available, non\-zero status is silently returned\&.  The option
\fB\-i\fP is accepted for compatibility but has no effect\&.
.RS
.PP
The \fIname\fPd module is searched for in the same way a command is, using
\fB$module_path\fP instead of \fB$path\fP\&.  However, the path search is
performed even when the module name contains a `\fB/\fP\&', which it usually does\&.
There is no way to prevent the path search\&.
.PP
If the module supports features (see below), \fBzmodload\fP tries to
enable all features when loading a module\&.  If the module was successfully
loaded but not all features could be enabled, \fBzmodload\fP returns status 2\&.
.PP
With \fB\-u\fP, \fBzmodload\fP unloads modules\&.  The same \fIname\fP
must be given that was given when the module was loaded, but it is not
necessary for the module to exist in the file system\&.
The \fB\-i\fP option suppresses the error if the module is already
unloaded (or was never loaded)\&.
.PP
Each module has a boot and a cleanup function\&.  The module
will not be loaded if its boot function fails\&.  Similarly a module
can only be unloaded if its cleanup function runs successfully\&.
.RE
.TP
\fBzmodload \-F\fP [ \fB\-almLe\fP \fB\-P\fP \fBparam\fP ] \fImodule\fP [\fB+\-\fP]\fIfeature\&.\&.\&.\fP
\fBzmodload \-F\fP allows more selective control over the features provided
by modules\&.  With no options apart from \fB\-F\fP, the module named
\fImodule\fP is loaded, if it was not already loaded, and the list of
\fIfeature\fPs is set to the required state\&.  If no 
\fIfeature\fPs are specified, the module is loaded, if it was not already
loaded, but the state of features is unchanged\&.  Each feature
may be preceded by a \fB+\fP to turn the feature on, or \fB\-\fP to turn it
off; the \fB+\fP is assumed if neither character is present\&.
Any feature not explicitly mentioned is left in its current state;
if the module was not previously loaded this means any such features will
remain disabled\&.  The return status is zero if all features were
set, 1 if the module failed to load, and 2 if some features could
not be set (for example, a parameter couldn\&'t be added because there
was a different parameter of the same name) but the module was loaded\&.
.RS
.PP
The standard features are builtins, conditions, parameters and math
functions; these are indicated by the prefix `\fBb:\fP\&', `\fBc:\fP'
(`\fBC:\fP\&' for an infix condition), `\fBp:\fP' and `\fBf:\fP', respectively,
followed by the name that the corresponding feature would have in the
shell\&.  For example, `\fBb:strftime\fP\&' indicates a builtin named
\fBstrftime\fP and \fBp:EPOCHSECONDS\fP indicates a parameter named
\fBEPOCHSECONDS\fP\&.  The module may provide other (`abstract\&') features of
its own as indicated by its documentation; these have no prefix\&.
.PP
With \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP, features provided by the module are listed\&.  With
\fB\-l\fP alone, a list of features together with their states is shown, one
feature per line\&.  With \fB\-L\fP alone, a \fBzmodload \-F\fP command that would
cause enabled features of the module to be turned on is shown\&.  With
\fB\-lL\fP, a \fBzmodload \-F\fP command that would cause all the features to be
set to their current state is shown\&.  If one of these combinations is given
the option \fB\-P\fP \fIparam\fP then the parameter \fBparam\fP is set to an
array of features, either features together with their state or (if
\fB\-L\fP alone is given) enabled features\&.
.PP
With the option \fB\-L\fP the module name may be omitted; then a list
of all enabled features for all modules providing features is printed
in the form of \fBzmodload \-F\fP commands\&.  If \fB\-l\fP is also given,
the state of both enabled and disabled features is output in that form\&.
.PP
A set of features may be provided together with \fB\-l\fP or \fB\-L\fP and a
module name; in that case only the state of those features is
considered\&.  Each feature may be preceded by \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP but the
character has no effect\&.  If no set of features is provided, all
features are considered\&.
.PP
With \fB\-e\fP, the command first tests that the module is loaded;
if it is not, status 1 is returned\&.  If the module is loaded,
the list of features given as an argument is examined\&.  Any feature
given with no prefix is simply tested to see if the module provides it;
any feature given with a prefix \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP is tested to
see if is provided and in the given state\&.  If the tests on all features
in the list succeed, status 0 is returned, else status 1\&.
.PP
With \fB\-m\fP, each entry in the given list of features is taken
as a pattern to be matched against the list of features provided
by the module\&.  An initial \fB+\fP or \fB\-\fP must be given explicitly\&.
This may not be combined with the \fB\-a\fP option as autoloads must
be specified explicitly\&.
.PP
With \fB\-a\fP, the given list of features is marked for autoload from
the specified module, which may not yet be loaded\&.  An optional \fB+\fP
may appear before the feature name\&.  If the feature is prefixed with
\fB\-\fP, any existing autoload is removed\&.  The options \fB\-l\fP and \fB\-L\fP
may be used to list autoloads\&.  Autoloading is specific to individual
features; when the module is loaded only the requested feature is
enabled\&.  Autoload requests are preserved if the module is
subsequently unloaded until an explicit `\fBzmodload \-Fa\fP \fImodule\fP
\fB\-\fP\fIfeature\fP\&' is issued\&.  It is not an error to request an autoload
for a feature of a module that is already loaded\&.
.PP
When the module is loaded each autoload is checked against the features
actually provided by the module; if the feature is not provided the
autoload request is deleted\&.  A warning message is output; if the
module is being loaded to provide a different feature, and that autoload
is successful, there is no effect on the status of the current command\&.
If the module is already loaded at the time when \fBzmodload \-Fa\fP is
run, an error message is printed and status 1 returned\&.
.PP
\fBzmodload \-Fa\fP can be used with the \fB\-l\fP, \fB\-L\fP, \fB\-e\fP and
\fB\-P\fP options for listing and testing the existence of autoloadable
features\&.  In this case \fB\-l\fP is ignored if \fB\-L\fP is specified\&.
\fBzmodload \-FaL\fP with no module name lists autoloads for all modules\&.
.PP
Note that only standard features as described above can be autoloaded;
other features require the module to be loaded before enabling\&.

in the first argument is loaded and all its features are enabled (for
selective control of features use `\fBzmodload \-F \-a\fP\&' as described
above)\&.  If only the \fIname\fP is given, one builtin is defined, with

\fImodule\fP instead\&.  If \fImodule\fP is not given, show the definition of
\fImodalias\fP\&.  If no arguments are given, list all defined module aliases\&.
When listing, if the \fB\-L\fP flag was also given, list the definition as a
\fBzmodload\fP command to recreate the alias\&.
.RS
.PP
The existence of aliases for modules is completely independent of whether
the name resolved is actually loaded as a module: while the alias exists,
loading and unloading the module under any alias has exactly the same
effect as using the resolved name, and does not affect the connection
between the alias and the resolved name which can be removed either by
\fBzmodload \-R\fP or by redefining the alias\&.  Chains of aliases (i\&.e\&. where
the first resolved name is itself an alias) are valid so long as these are
not circular\&.  As the aliases take the same format as module names, they
may include path separators:  in this case, there is no requirement for any
part of the path named to exist as the alias will be resolved first\&.  For
example, `\fBany/old/alias\fP\&' is always a valid alias\&.
.PP
Dependencies added to aliased modules are actually added to the resolved
module; these remain if the alias is removed\&.  It is valid to create an
alias whose name is one of the standard shell modules and which resolves to
a different module\&.  However, if a module has dependencies, it
will not be possible to use the module name as an alias as the module will
already be marked as a loadable module in its own right\&.
.PP
Apart from the above, aliases can be used in the \fBzmodload\fP command
anywhere module names are required\&.  However, aliases will not be
shown in lists of loaded modules with a bare `\fBzmodload\fP\&'\&.

For each \fImodalias\fP argument that was previously defined as a module

.PP
Note that \fBzsh\fP makes no distinction between modules that were linked 
into the shell and modules that are loaded dynamically\&. In both cases
this builtin command has to be used to make available the builtins and
other things defined by modules (unless the module is autoloaded on
these definitions)\&. This is true even for systems that don\&'t support
dynamic loading of modules\&.
