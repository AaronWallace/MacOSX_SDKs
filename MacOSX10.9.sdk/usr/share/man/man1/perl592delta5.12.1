.SH "NAME"
perl592delta \- what is new for perl v5.9.2
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document describes differences between the 5.9.1 and the 5.9.2
development releases. See perl590delta and perl591delta for the
differences between 5.8.0 and 5.9.1.
.SH "Incompatible Changes"
.IX Header "Incompatible Changes"
.SS "Packing and \s-1UTF\-8\s0 strings"
.IX Subsection "Packing and UTF-8 strings"
The semantics of \fIpack()\fR and \fIunpack()\fR regarding UTF\-8\-encoded data has been
changed. Processing is now by default character per character instead of
byte per byte on the underlying encoding. Notably, code that used things
like \f(CW\*(C`pack("a*", $string)\*(C'\fR to see through the encoding of string will now
simply get back the original \f(CW$string\fR. Packed strings can also get upgraded
during processing when you store upgraded characters. You can get the old
behaviour by using \f(CW\*(C`use bytes\*(C'\fR.
.PP
To be consistent with \fIpack()\fR, the \f(CW\*(C`C0\*(C'\fR in \fIunpack()\fR templates indicates
that the data is to be processed in character mode, i.e. character by
character; on the contrary, \f(CW\*(C`U0\*(C'\fR in \fIunpack()\fR indicates \s-1UTF\-8\s0 mode, where
the packed string is processed in its UTF\-8\-encoded Unicode form on a byte
by byte basis. This is reversed with regard to perl 5.8.X.
.PP
Moreover, \f(CW\*(C`C0\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`U0\*(C'\fR can also be used in \fIpack()\fR templates to specify
respectively character and byte modes.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`C0\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`U0\*(C'\fR in the middle of a pack or unpack format now switch to the
specified encoding mode, honoring parens grouping. Previously, parens were
ignored.
.PP
Also, there is a new \fIpack()\fR character format, \f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR, which is intended to
replace the old \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR is kept for unsigned chars coded as bytes in
the strings internal representation. \f(CW\*(C`W\*(C'\fR represents unsigned (logical)
character values, which can be greater than 255. It is therefore more
robust when dealing with potentially UTF\-8\-encoded data (as \f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR will wrap
values outside the range 0..255, and not respect the string encoding).
.PP
In practice, that means that pack formats are now encoding-neutral, except
\&\f(CW\*(C`C\*(C'\fR.
.PP
For consistency, \f(CW\*(C`A\*(C'\fR in \fIunpack()\fR format now trims all Unicode whitespace
from the end of the string. Before perl 5.9.2, it used to strip only the
classical \s-1ASCII\s0 space characters.
.SS "Miscellaneous"
.IX Subsection "Miscellaneous"
The internal dump output has been improved, so that non-printable characters
such as newline and backspace are output in \f(CW\*(C`\ex\*(C'\fR notation, rather than
octal.
.PP
The \fB\-C\fR option can no longer be used on the \f(CW\*(C`#!\*(C'\fR line. It wasn't
working there anyway.
.SH "Core Enhancements"
.IX Header "Core Enhancements"
.SS "Malloc wrapping"
.IX Subsection "Malloc wrapping"
Perl can now be built to detect attempts to assign pathologically large chunks
of memory.  Previously such assignments would suffer from integer wrap-around
during size calculations causing a misallocation, which would crash perl, and
could theoretically be used for \*(L"stack smashing\*(R" attacks.  The wrapping
defaults to enabled on platforms where we know it works (most \s-1AIX\s0
configurations, BSDi, Darwin, \s-1DEC\s0 \s-1OSF/1\s0, FreeBSD, HP-UX, \s-1GNU\s0 Linux, OpenBSD,
Solaris, \s-1VMS\s0 and most Win32 compilers) and defaults to disabled on other
platforms.
.SS "Unicode Character Database 4.0.1"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Character Database 4.0.1"
The copy of the Unicode Character Database included in Perl 5.9 has
been updated to 4.0.1 from 4.0.0.
.SS "suidperl less insecure"
.IX Subsection "suidperl less insecure"
Paul Szabo has analysed and patched \f(CW\*(C`suidperl\*(C'\fR to remove existing known
insecurities. Currently there are no known holes in \f(CW\*(C`suidperl\*(C'\fR, but previous
experience shows that we cannot be confident that these were the last. You may
no longer invoke the set uid perl directly, so to preserve backwards
compatibility with scripts that invoke #!/usr/bin/suidperl the only set uid
binary is now \f(CW\*(C`sperl5.9.\*(C'\fR\fIn\fR (\f(CW\*(C`sperl5.9.2\*(C'\fR for this release). \f(CW\*(C`suidperl\*(C'\fR
is installed as a hard link to \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR; both \f(CW\*(C`suidperl\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`perl\*(C'\fR will
invoke \f(CW\*(C`sperl5.9.2\*(C'\fR automatically the set uid binary, so this change should
be completely transparent.
.PP
For new projects the core perl team would strongly recommend that you use
dedicated, single purpose security tools such as \f(CW\*(C`sudo\*(C'\fR in preference to
\&\f(CW\*(C`suidperl\*(C'\fR.
.SS "\s-1PERLIO_DEBUG\s0"
.IX Subsection "PERLIO_DEBUG"
The \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR environment variable has no longer any effect for
setuid scripts and for scripts run with \fB\-T\fR.
.PP
Moreover, with a thread-enabled perl, using \f(CW\*(C`PERLIO_DEBUG\*(C'\fR could lead to
an internal buffer overflow. This has been fixed.
.SS "Formats"
.IX Subsection "Formats"
In addition to bug fixes, \f(CW\*(C`format\*(C'\fR's features have been enhanced. See
perlform.
.SS "Unicode Character Classes"
.IX Subsection "Unicode Character Classes"
Perl's regular expression engine now contains support for matching on the
intersection of two Unicode character classes. You can also now refer to
user-defined character classes from within other user defined character
classes.
.SS "Byte-order modifiers for \fIpack()\fP and \fIunpack()\fP"
.IX Subsection "Byte-order modifiers for pack() and unpack()"
There are two new byte-order modifiers, \f(CW\*(C`>\*(C'\fR (big-endian) and \f(CW\*(C`<\*(C'\fR
(little-endian), that can be appended to most \fIpack()\fR and \fIunpack()\fR template
characters and groups to force a certain byte-order for that type or group.
See \*(L"pack\*(R" in perlfunc and perlpacktut for details.
.SS "Byte count feature in \fIpack()\fP"
.IX Subsection "Byte count feature in pack()"
A new \fIpack()\fR template character, \f(CW"."\fR, returns the number of characters
read so far.
.SS "New variables"
.IX Subsection "New variables"
A new variable, ${^RE_DEBUG_FLAGS}, controls what debug flags are in
effect for the regular expression engine when running under \f(CW\*(C`use re
"debug"\*(C'\fR. See re for details.
.PP
A new variable ${^UTF8LOCALE} indicates where a \s-1UTF\-8\s0 locale was detected
by perl at startup.

added.
.IP "\(bu" 4
The Perl debugger can now save all debugger commands for sourcing later;
notably, it can now emulate stepping backwards, by restarting and
rerunning all bar the last command from a saved command history.

Perl has a new \-dt command-line flag, which enables threads support in the

optimization.
.SH "Installation and Configuration Improvements"
.IX Header "Installation and Configuration Improvements"
Run-time customization of \f(CW@INC\fR can be enabled by passing the
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Dusesitecustomize\*(C'\fR flag to configure. When enabled, this will make perl
run \fI\f(CI$sitelibexp\fI/sitecustomize.pl\fR before anything else.  This script can
then be set up to add additional entries to \f(CW@INC\fR.
.PP
There is alpha support for relocatable \f(CW@INC\fR entries.
.PP
Perl should build on Interix and on GNU/kFreeBSD.
.SH "Selected Bug Fixes"
.IX Header "Selected Bug Fixes"
Most of those bugs were reported in the perl 5.8.x maintenance track.
Notably, quite a few utf8 bugs were fixed, and several memory leaks were
suppressed. The perl58Xdelta manpages have more details on them.
.PP
Development-only bug fixes include :
.PP
\&\f(CW$Foo::_\fR was wrongly forced as \f(CW$main::_\fR.
.SH "New or Changed Diagnostics"
.IX Header "New or Changed Diagnostics"
A new warning, \f(CW\*(C`!=~ should be !~\*(C'\fR, is emitted to prevent this misspelling
of the non-matching operator.
.PP
The warning \fINewline in left-justified string\fR has been removed.
.PP
The error \fIToo late for \*(L"\-T\*(R" option\fR has been reformulated to be more
descriptive.
.PP
There is a new compilation error, \fIIllegal declaration of subroutine\fR,
for an obscure case of syntax errors.
.PP
The diagnostic output of Carp has been changed slightly, to add a space after
the comma between arguments. This makes it much easier for tools such as
web browsers to wrap it, but might confuse any automatic tools which perform
detailed parsing of Carp output.
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl \-V\*(C'\fR has several improvements, making it more useable from shell
scripts to get the value of configuration variables. See perlrun for
details.
.SH "Changed Internals"

In short, this release will not be binary compatible with any previous
