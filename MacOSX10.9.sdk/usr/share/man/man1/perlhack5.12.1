perlhack \- How to hack at the Perl internals
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This document attempts to explain how Perl development takes place,
and ends with some suggestions for people wanting to become bona fide
porters.
.PP
The perl5\-porters mailing list is where the Perl standard distribution
is maintained and developed.  The list can get anywhere from 10 to 150
messages a day, depending on the heatedness of the debate.  Most days
there are two or three patches, extensions, features, or bugs being
discussed at a time.
.PP
A searchable archive of the list is at either:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    http://www.xray.mpe.mpg.de/mailing\-lists/perl5\-porters/
.Ve
.PP
or
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    http://archive.develooper.com/perl5\-porters@perl.org/
.Ve
.PP
List subscribers (the porters themselves) come in several flavours.
Some are quiet curious lurkers, who rarely pitch in and instead watch
the ongoing development to ensure they're forewarned of new changes or
features in Perl.  Some are representatives of vendors, who are there
to make sure that Perl continues to compile and work on their
platforms.  Some patch any reported bug that they know how to fix,
some are actively patching their pet area (threads, Win32, the regexp
engine), while others seem to do nothing but complain.  In other
words, it's your usual mix of technical people.
.PP
Over this group of porters presides Larry Wall.  He has the final word
in what does and does not change in the Perl language.  Various
releases of Perl are shepherded by a \*(L"pumpking\*(R", a porter
responsible for gathering patches, deciding on a patch-by-patch,
feature-by-feature basis what will and will not go into the release.
For instance, Gurusamy Sarathy was the pumpking for the 5.6 release of
Perl, and Jarkko Hietaniemi was the pumpking for the 5.8 release, and
Rafael Garcia-Suarez holds the pumpking crown for the 5.10 release.
.PP
In addition, various people are pumpkings for different things.  For
instance, Andy Dougherty and Jarkko Hietaniemi did a grand job as the
\&\fIConfigure\fR pumpkin up till the 5.8 release. For the 5.10 release
H.Merijn Brand took over.
.PP
Larry sees Perl development along the lines of the \s-1US\s0 government:
there's the Legislature (the porters), the Executive branch (the
pumpkings), and the Supreme Court (Larry).  The legislature can
discuss and submit patches to the executive branch all they like, but
the executive branch is free to veto them.  Rarely, the Supreme Court
will side with the executive branch over the legislature, or the
legislature over the executive branch.  Mostly, however, the
legislature and the executive branch are supposed to get along and
work out their differences without impeachment or court cases.
.PP
You might sometimes see reference to Rule 1 and Rule 2.  Larry's power
as Supreme Court is expressed in The Rules:
.IP "1." 4
Larry is always by definition right about how Perl should behave.
This means he has final veto power on the core functionality.
.IP "2." 4
Larry is allowed to change his mind about any matter at a later date,
regardless of whether he previously invoked Rule 1.
.PP
Got that?  Larry is always right, even when he was wrong.  It's rare
to see either Rule exercised, but they are often alluded to.
.PP
New features and extensions to the language are contentious, because
the criteria used by the pumpkings, Larry, and other porters to decide
which features should be implemented and incorporated are not codified
in a few small design goals as with some other languages.  Instead,
the heuristics are flexible and often difficult to fathom.  Here is
one person's list, roughly in decreasing order of importance, of
heuristics that new features have to be weighed against:
.IP "Does concept match the general goals of Perl?" 4
.IX Item "Does concept match the general goals of Perl?"
These haven't been written anywhere in stone, but one approximation
is:
.Sp
.Vb 5
\& 1. Keep it fast, simple, and useful.
\& 2. Keep features/concepts as orthogonal as possible.
\& 3. No arbitrary limits (platforms, data sizes, cultures).
\& 4. Keep it open and exciting to use/patch/advocate Perl everywhere.
\& 5. Either assimilate new technologies, or build bridges to them.
.Ve
.IP "Where is the implementation?" 4
.IX Item "Where is the implementation?"
All the talk in the world is useless without an implementation.  In
almost every case, the person or people who argue for a new feature
will be expected to be the ones who implement it.  Porters capable
of coding new features have their own agendas, and are not available
to implement your (possibly good) idea.
.IP "Backwards compatibility" 4
.IX Item "Backwards compatibility"
It's a cardinal sin to break existing Perl programs.  New warnings are
contentious\*(--some say that a program that emits warnings is not
broken, while others say it is.  Adding keywords has the potential to
break programs, changing the meaning of existing token sequences or
functions might break programs.
.IP "Could it be a module instead?" 4
.IX Item "Could it be a module instead?"
Perl 5 has extension mechanisms, modules and \s-1XS\s0, specifically to avoid
the need to keep changing the Perl interpreter.  You can write modules
that export functions, you can give those functions prototypes so they
can be called like built-in functions, you can even write \s-1XS\s0 code to
mess with the runtime data structures of the Perl interpreter if you
want to implement really complicated things.  If it can be done in a
module instead of in the core, it's highly unlikely to be added.
.IP "Is the feature generic enough?" 4
.IX Item "Is the feature generic enough?"
Is this something that only the submitter wants added to the language,
or would it be broadly useful?  Sometimes, instead of adding a feature
with a tight focus, the porters might decide to wait until someone
implements the more generalized feature.  For instance, instead of
implementing a \*(L"delayed evaluation\*(R" feature, the porters are waiting
for a macro system that would permit delayed evaluation and much more.
.IP "Does it potentially introduce new bugs?" 4
.IX Item "Does it potentially introduce new bugs?"
Radical rewrites of large chunks of the Perl interpreter have the
potential to introduce new bugs.  The smaller and more localized the
change, the better.
.IP "Does it preclude other desirable features?" 4
.IX Item "Does it preclude other desirable features?"
A patch is likely to be rejected if it closes off future avenues of
development.  For instance, a patch that placed a true and final
interpretation on prototypes is likely to be rejected because there
are still options for the future of prototypes that haven't been
addressed.
.IP "Is the implementation robust?" 4
.IX Item "Is the implementation robust?"
Good patches (tight code, complete, correct) stand more chance of
going in.  Sloppy or incorrect patches might be placed on the back
burner until the pumpking has time to fix, or might be discarded
altogether without further notice.
.IP "Is the implementation generic enough to be portable?" 4
.IX Item "Is the implementation generic enough to be portable?"
The worst patches make use of a system-specific features.  It's highly
unlikely that non-portable additions to the Perl language will be
accepted.
.IP "Is the implementation tested?" 4
.IX Item "Is the implementation tested?"
Patches which change behaviour (fixing bugs or introducing new features)
must include regression tests to verify that everything works as expected.
Without tests provided by the original author, how can anyone else changing
perl in the future be sure that they haven't unwittingly broken the behaviour
the patch implements? And without tests, how can the patch's author be
confident that his/her hard work put into the patch won't be accidentally
thrown away by someone in the future?
.IP "Is there enough documentation?" 4
.IX Item "Is there enough documentation?"
Patches without documentation are probably ill-thought out or
incomplete.  Nothing can be added without documentation, so submitting
a patch for the appropriate manpages as well as the source code is
always a good idea.
.IP "Is there another way to do it?" 4
.IX Item "Is there another way to do it?"
Larry said "Although the Perl Slogan is \fIThere's More Than One Way
to Do It\fR, I hesitate to make 10 ways to do something".  This is a
tricky heuristic to navigate, though\*(--one man's essential addition is
another man's pointless cruft.
.IP "Does it create too much work?" 4
.IX Item "Does it create too much work?"
Work for the pumpking, work for Perl programmers, work for module
authors, ...  Perl is supposed to be easy.
.IP "Patches speak louder than words" 4
.IX Item "Patches speak louder than words"
Working code is always preferred to pie-in-the-sky ideas.  A patch to
add a feature stands a much higher chance of making it to the language
than does a random feature request, no matter how fervently argued the
request might be.  This ties into \*(L"Will it be useful?\*(R", as the fact
that someone took the time to make the patch demonstrates a strong
desire for the feature.
.PP
If you're on the list, you might hear the word \*(L"core\*(R" bandied
around.  It refers to the standard distribution.  \*(L"Hacking on the
core\*(R" means you're changing the C source code to the Perl
interpreter.  \*(L"A core module\*(R" is one that ships with Perl.
.SS "Keeping in sync"
.IX Subsection "Keeping in sync"
The source code to the Perl interpreter, in its different versions, is
kept in a repository managed by the git revision control system. The
pumpkings and a few others have write access to the repository to check in
changes.
.PP
How to clone and use the git perl repository is described in perlrepository.
.PP
You can also choose to use rsync to get a copy of the current source tree
for the bleadperl branch and all maintenance branches:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    $ rsync \-avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl\-current .
\&    $ rsync \-avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl\-5.12.x .
\&    $ rsync \-avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl\-5.10.x .
\&    $ rsync \-avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl\-5.8.x .
\&    $ rsync \-avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl\-5.6.x .
\&    $ rsync \-avz rsync://perl5.git.perl.org/perl\-5.005xx .
.Ve
.PP
(Add the \f(CW\*(C`\-\-delete\*(C'\fR option to remove leftover files)
.PP
To get a full list of the available sync points:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    $ rsync perl5.git.perl.org::
.Ve
.PP
You may also want to subscribe to the perl5\-changes mailing list to
receive a copy of each patch that gets submitted to the maintenance
and development \*(L"branches\*(R" of the perl repository.  See
http://lists.perl.org/ for subscription information.
.PP
If you are a member of the perl5\-porters mailing list, it is a good
thing to keep in touch with the most recent changes. If not only to
verify if what you would have posted as a bug report isn't already
solved in the most recent available perl development branch, also
known as perl-current, bleading edge perl, bleedperl or bleadperl.
.PP
Needless to say, the source code in perl-current is usually in a perpetual
state of evolution.  You should expect it to be very buggy.  Do \fBnot\fR use
it for any purpose other than testing and development.
.SS "Perlbug administration"
.IX Subsection "Perlbug administration"
There is a single remote administrative interface for modifying bug status,
category, open issues etc. using the \fB\s-1RT\s0\fR bugtracker system, maintained
by Robert Spier.  Become an administrator, and close any bugs you can get
your sticky mitts on:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        http://bugs.perl.org/
.Ve
.PP
To email the bug system administrators:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        "perlbug\-admin" <perlbug\-admin@perl.org>
.Ve
.SS "Submitting patches"
.IX Subsection "Submitting patches"
Always submit patches to \fIperl5\-porters@perl.org\fR.  If you're
patching a core module and there's an author listed, send the author a
copy (see \*(L"Patching a core module\*(R").  This lets other porters review
your patch, which catches a surprising number of errors in patches.
Please patch against the latest \fBdevelopment\fR version. (e.g., even if
you're fixing a bug in the 5.8 track, patch against the \f(CW\*(C`blead\*(C'\fR branch in
the git repository.)
.PP
If changes are accepted, they are applied to the development branch. Then
the maintenance pumpking decides which of those patches is to be
backported to the maint branch.  Only patches that survive the heat of the
development branch get applied to maintenance versions.
.PP
Your patch should update the documentation and test suite.  See
\&\*(L"Writing a test\*(R".  If you have added or removed files in the distribution,
edit the \s-1MANIFEST\s0 file accordingly, sort the \s-1MANIFEST\s0 file using
\&\f(CW\*(C`make manisort\*(C'\fR, and include those changes as part of your patch.
.PP
Patching documentation also follows the same order: if accepted, a patch
is first applied to \fBdevelopment\fR, and if relevant then it's backported
to \fBmaintenance\fR. (With an exception for some patches that document
behaviour that only appears in the maintenance branch, but which has
changed in the development version.)
.PP
To report a bug in Perl, use the program \fIperlbug\fR which comes with
Perl (if you can't get Perl to work, send mail to the address
\&\fIperlbug@perl.org\fR or \fIperlbug@perl.com\fR).  Reporting bugs through
\&\fIperlbug\fR feeds into the automated bug-tracking system, access to
which is provided through the web at http://rt.perl.org/rt3/ .  It
often pays to check the archives of the perl5\-porters mailing list to
see whether the bug you're reporting has been reported before, and if
so whether it was considered a bug.  See above for the location of
the searchable archives.
.PP
The \s-1CPAN\s0 testers ( http://testers.cpan.org/ ) are a group of
volunteers who test \s-1CPAN\s0 modules on a variety of platforms.  Perl
Smokers ( http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.daily\-build and
http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.daily\-build.reports/ )
automatically test Perl source releases on platforms with various
configurations.  Both efforts welcome volunteers. In order to get
involved in smoke testing of the perl itself visit
http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test\-Smoke <http://search.cpan.org/dist/Test-Smoke>. In order to start smoke
testing \s-1CPAN\s0 modules visit http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS\-YACSmoke/ <http://search.cpan.org/dist/CPANPLUS-YACSmoke/>

.PP
It's a good idea to read and lurk for a while before chipping in.
That way you'll get to see the dynamic of the conversations, learn the
personalities of the players, and hopefully be better prepared to make
a useful contribution when do you speak up.
.PP
If after all this you still think you want to join the perl5\-porters
mailing list, send mail to \fIperl5\-porters\-subscribe@perl.org\fR.  To
unsubscribe, send mail to \fIperl5\-porters\-unsubscribe@perl.org\fR.
.PP
To hack on the Perl guts, you'll need to read the following things:
.IP "perlguts" 3
.IX Item "perlguts"
This is of paramount importance, since it's the documentation of what
goes where in the Perl source. Read it over a couple of times and it
might start to make sense \- don't worry if it doesn't yet, because the
best way to study it is to read it in conjunction with poking at Perl
source, and we'll do that later on.
.Sp
Gisle Aas's \*(L"illustrated perlguts\*(R", also known as \fIillguts\fR, has very
helpful pictures:
.Sp
<http://search.cpan.org/dist/illguts/>
.IP "perlxstut and perlxs" 3
.IX Item "perlxstut and perlxs"
A working knowledge of \s-1XSUB\s0 programming is incredibly useful for core
hacking; XSUBs use techniques drawn from the \s-1PP\s0 code, the portion of the
guts that actually executes a Perl program. It's a lot gentler to learn
those techniques from simple examples and explanation than from the core
itself.
.IP "perlapi" 3
.IX Item "perlapi"
The documentation for the Perl \s-1API\s0 explains what some of the internal
functions do, as well as the many macros used in the source.
.IP "\fIPorting/pumpkin.pod\fR" 3
.IX Item "Porting/pumpkin.pod"
This is a collection of words of wisdom for a Perl porter; some of it is
only useful to the pumpkin holder, but most of it applies to anyone
wanting to go about Perl development.
.IP "The perl5\-porters \s-1FAQ\s0" 3
.IX Item "The perl5-porters FAQ"
This should be available from http://dev.perl.org/perl5/docs/p5p\-faq.html .
It contains hints on reading perl5\-porters, information on how
perl5\-porters works and how Perl development in general works.
.SS "Finding Your Way Around"
.IX Subsection "Finding Your Way Around"
Perl maintenance can be split into a number of areas, and certain people
(pumpkins) will have responsibility for each area. These areas sometimes
correspond to files or directories in the source kit. Among the areas are:
.IP "Core modules" 3
.IX Item "Core modules"
Modules shipped as part of the Perl core live in various subdirectories, where
two are dedicated to core-only modules, and two are for the dual-life modules
which live on \s-1CPAN\s0 and may be maintained separately with respect to the Perl
core:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    lib/  is for pure\-Perl modules, which exist in the core only.
\&
\&    ext/  is for XS extensions, and modules with special Makefile.PL
\&          requirements, which exist in the core only.
\&
\&    cpan/ is for dual\-life modules, where the CPAN module is
\&          canonical (should be patched first).
\&
\&    dist/ is for dual\-life modules, where the blead source is
\&          canonical.
.Ve
.Sp
For some dual-life modules it has not been discussed if the \s-1CPAN\s0 version or the
blead source is canonical. Until that is done, those modules should be in
\&\fIcpan/\fR.
.IP "Tests" 3
.IX Item "Tests"
There are tests for nearly all the modules, built-ins and major bits
of functionality.  Test files all have a .t suffix.  Module tests live
in the \fIlib/\fR and \fIext/\fR directories next to the module being
tested.  Others live in \fIt/\fR.  See \*(L"Writing a test\*(R"
.IP "Documentation" 3
.IX Item "Documentation"
Documentation maintenance includes looking after everything in the
\&\fIpod/\fR directory, (as well as contributing new documentation) and
the documentation to the modules in core.
.IP "Configure" 3
.IX Item "Configure"
The Configure process is the way we make Perl portable across the
myriad of operating systems it supports. Responsibility for the
Configure, build and installation process, as well as the overall
portability of the core code rests with the Configure pumpkin \-
others help out with individual operating systems.
.Sp
The three files that fall under his/her responsibility are Configure,
config_h.SH, and Porting/Glossary (and a whole bunch of small related
files that are less important here). The Configure pumpkin decides how
patches to these are dealt with. Currently, the Configure pumpkin will
accept patches in most common formats, even directly to these files.
Other committers are allowed to commit to these files under the strict
condition that they will inform the Configure pumpkin, either on \s-1IRC\s0
(if he/she happens to be around) or through (personal) e\-mail.
.Sp
The files involved are the operating system directories, (\fIwin32/\fR,
\&\fIos2/\fR, \fIvms/\fR and so on) the shell scripts which generate \fIconfig.h\fR
and \fIMakefile\fR, as well as the metaconfig files which generate
\&\fIConfigure\fR. (metaconfig isn't included in the core distribution.)
.Sp
See http://perl5.git.perl.org/metaconfig.git/blob/HEAD:/README for a
description of the full process involved.
.IP "Interpreter" 3
.IX Item "Interpreter"
And of course, there's the core of the Perl interpreter itself. Let's
have a look at that in a little more detail.
.PP
Before we leave looking at the layout, though, don't forget that
\&\fI\s-1MANIFEST\s0\fR contains not only the file names in the Perl distribution,
but short descriptions of what's in them, too. For an overview of the
important files, try this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    perl \-lne \*(Aqprint if /^[^\e/]+\e.[ch]\es+/\*(Aq MANIFEST
.Ve
.SS "Elements of the interpreter"
.IX Subsection "Elements of the interpreter"
The work of the interpreter has two main stages: compiling the code
into the internal representation, or bytecode, and then executing it.
\&\*(L"Compiled code\*(R" in perlguts explains exactly how the compilation stage
happens.
.PP
Here is a short breakdown of perl's operation:
.IP "Startup" 3
.IX Item "Startup"
The action begins in \fIperlmain.c\fR. (or \fIminiperlmain.c\fR for miniperl)
This is very high-level code, enough to fit on a single screen, and it
resembles the code found in perlembed; most of the real action takes
place in \fIperl.c\fR
.Sp
\&\fIperlmain.c\fR is generated by writemain from \fIminiperlmain.c\fR at
make time, so you should make perl to follow this along.
.Sp
First, \fIperlmain.c\fR allocates some memory and constructs a Perl
interpreter, along these lines:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    1 PERL_SYS_INIT3(&argc,&argv,&env);
\&    2
\&    3 if (!PL_do_undump) {
\&    4     my_perl = perl_alloc();
\&    5     if (!my_perl)
\&    6         exit(1);
\&    7     perl_construct(my_perl);
\&    8     PL_perl_destruct_level = 0;
\&    9 }
.Ve
.Sp
Line 1 is a macro, and its definition is dependent on your operating
system. Line 3 references \f(CW\*(C`PL_do_undump\*(C'\fR, a global variable \- all
global variables in Perl start with \f(CW\*(C`PL_\*(C'\fR. This tells you whether the
current running program was created with the \f(CW\*(C`\-u\*(C'\fR flag to perl and then
\&\fIundump\fR, which means it's going to be false in any sane context.
.Sp
Line 4 calls a function in \fIperl.c\fR to allocate memory for a Perl
interpreter. It's quite a simple function, and the guts of it looks like
this:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\& my_perl = (PerlInterpreter*)PerlMem_malloc(sizeof(PerlInterpreter));
.Ve
.Sp
Here you see an example of Perl's system abstraction, which we'll see
later: \f(CW\*(C`PerlMem_malloc\*(C'\fR is either your system's \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR, or Perl's
own \f(CW\*(C`malloc\*(C'\fR as defined in \fImalloc.c\fR if you selected that option at
configure time.
.Sp
Next, in line 7, we construct the interpreter using perl_construct, 
also in \fIperl.c\fR; this sets up all the special variables that Perl 
needs, the stacks, and so on.
.Sp
Now we pass Perl the command line options, and tell it to go:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\& exitstatus = perl_parse(my_perl, xs_init, argc, argv, (char **)NULL);
\& if (!exitstatus)
\&     perl_run(my_perl);
\&
\& exitstatus = perl_destruct(my_perl);
\&
\& perl_free(my_perl);
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`perl_parse\*(C'\fR is actually a wrapper around \f(CW\*(C`S_parse_body\*(C'\fR, as defined
in \fIperl.c\fR, which processes the command line options, sets up any
statically linked \s-1XS\s0 modules, opens the program and calls \f(CW\*(C`yyparse\*(C'\fR to
parse it.
.IP "Parsing" 3
.IX Item "Parsing"
The aim of this stage is to take the Perl source, and turn it into an op
tree. We'll see what one of those looks like later. Strictly speaking,
there's three things going on here.
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`yyparse\*(C'\fR, the parser, lives in \fIperly.c\fR, although you're better off
reading the original \s-1YACC\s0 input in \fIperly.y\fR. (Yes, Virginia, there
\&\fBis\fR a \s-1YACC\s0 grammar for Perl!) The job of the parser is to take your
code and \*(L"understand\*(R" it, splitting it into sentences, deciding which
operands go with which operators and so on.
.Sp
The parser is nobly assisted by the lexer, which chunks up your input
into tokens, and decides what type of thing each token is: a variable
name, an operator, a bareword, a subroutine, a core function, and so on.
The main point of entry to the lexer is \f(CW\*(C`yylex\*(C'\fR, and that and its
associated routines can be found in \fItoke.c\fR. Perl isn't much like
other computer languages; it's highly context sensitive at times, it can
be tricky to work out what sort of token something is, or where a token
ends. As such, there's a lot of interplay between the tokeniser and the
parser, which can get pretty frightening if you're not used to it.
.Sp
As the parser understands a Perl program, it builds up a tree of
operations for the interpreter to perform during execution. The routines
which construct and link together the various operations are to be found
in \fIop.c\fR, and will be examined later.
.IP "Optimization" 3
.IX Item "Optimization"
Now the parsing stage is complete, and the finished tree represents
the operations that the Perl interpreter needs to perform to execute our
program. Next, Perl does a dry run over the tree looking for
optimisations: constant expressions such as \f(CW\*(C`3 + 4\*(C'\fR will be computed
now, and the optimizer will also see if any multiple operations can be
replaced with a single one. For instance, to fetch the variable \f(CW$foo\fR,
instead of grabbing the glob \f(CW*foo\fR and looking at the scalar
component, the optimizer fiddles the op tree to use a function which
directly looks up the scalar in question. The main optimizer is \f(CW\*(C`peep\*(C'\fR
in \fIop.c\fR, and many ops have their own optimizing functions.
.IP "Running" 3
.IX Item "Running"
Now we're finally ready to go: we have compiled Perl byte code, and all
that's left to do is run it. The actual execution is done by the
\&\f(CW\*(C`runops_standard\*(C'\fR function in \fIrun.c\fR; more specifically, it's done by
these three innocent looking lines:
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&    while ((PL_op = CALL_FPTR(PL_op\->op_ppaddr)(aTHX))) {
\&        PERL_ASYNC_CHECK();
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
You may be more comfortable with the Perl version of that:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    PERL_ASYNC_CHECK() while $Perl::op = &{$Perl::op\->{function}};
.Ve
.Sp
Well, maybe not. Anyway, each op contains a function pointer, which
stipulates the function which will actually carry out the operation.
This function will return the next op in the sequence \- this allows for
things like \f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR which choose the next op dynamically at run time.
The \f(CW\*(C`PERL_ASYNC_CHECK\*(C'\fR makes sure that things like signals interrupt
execution if required.
.Sp
The actual functions called are known as \s-1PP\s0 code, and they're spread
between four files: \fIpp_hot.c\fR contains the \*(L"hot\*(R" code, which is most
often used and highly optimized, \fIpp_sys.c\fR contains all the
system-specific functions, \fIpp_ctl.c\fR contains the functions which
implement control structures (\f(CW\*(C`if\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`while\*(C'\fR and the like) and \fIpp.c\fR
contains everything else. These are, if you like, the C code for Perl's
built-in functions and operators.
.Sp
Note that each \f(CW\*(C`pp_\*(C'\fR function is expected to return a pointer to the next
op. Calls to perl subs (and eval blocks) are handled within the same
runops loop, and do not consume extra space on the C stack. For example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`pp_entersub\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`pp_entertry\*(C'\fR just push a \f(CW\*(C`CxSUB\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR block
struct onto the context stack which contain the address of the op
following the sub call or eval. They then return the first op of that sub
or eval block, and so execution continues of that sub or block.  Later, a
\&\f(CW\*(C`pp_leavesub\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`pp_leavetry\*(C'\fR op pops the \f(CW\*(C`CxSUB\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR,
retrieves the return op from it, and returns it.
.IP "Exception handing" 3
.IX Item "Exception handing"
Perl's exception handing (i.e. \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR etc.) is built on top of the low-level
\&\f(CW\*(C`setjmp()\*(C'\fR/\f(CW\*(C`longjmp()\*(C'\fR C\-library functions. These basically provide a
way to capture the current \s-1PC\s0 and \s-1SP\s0 registers and later restore them; i.e.
a \f(CW\*(C`longjmp()\*(C'\fR continues at the point in code where a previous \f(CW\*(C`setjmp()\*(C'\fR
was done, with anything further up on the C stack being lost. This is why
code should always save values using \f(CW\*(C`SAVE_FOO\*(C'\fR rather than in auto
variables.
.Sp
The perl core wraps \f(CW\*(C`setjmp()\*(C'\fR etc in the macros \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV_PUSH\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`JMPENV_JUMP\*(C'\fR. The basic rule of perl exceptions is that \f(CW\*(C`exit\*(C'\fR, and
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR (in the absence of \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR) perform a \f(CWJMPENV_JUMP(2)\fR, while
\&\f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR within \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR does a \f(CWJMPENV_JUMP(3)\fR.
.Sp
At entry points to perl, such as \f(CW\*(C`perl_parse()\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`perl_run()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`call_sv(cv, G_EVAL)\*(C'\fR each does a \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV_PUSH\*(C'\fR, then enter a runops
loop or whatever, and handle possible exception returns. For a 2 return,
final cleanup is performed, such as popping stacks and calling \f(CW\*(C`CHECK\*(C'\fR or
\&\f(CW\*(C`END\*(C'\fR blocks. Amongst other things, this is how scope cleanup still
occurs during an \f(CW\*(C`exit\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
If a \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR can find a \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR block on the context stack, then the
stack is popped to that level and the return op in that block is assigned
to \f(CW\*(C`PL_restartop\*(C'\fR; then a \f(CWJMPENV_JUMP(3)\fR is performed.  This normally
passes control back to the guard. In the case of \f(CW\*(C`perl_run\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`call_sv\*(C'\fR, a non-null \f(CW\*(C`PL_restartop\*(C'\fR triggers re-entry to the runops
loop. The is the normal way that \f(CW\*(C`die\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`croak\*(C'\fR is handled within an
\&\f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Sometimes ops are executed within an inner runops loop, such as tie, sort
or overload code. In this case, something like
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    sub FETCH { eval { die } }
.Ve
.Sp
would cause a longjmp right back to the guard in \f(CW\*(C`perl_run\*(C'\fR, popping both
runops loops, which is clearly incorrect. One way to avoid this is for the
tie code to do a \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV_PUSH\*(C'\fR before executing \f(CW\*(C`FETCH\*(C'\fR in the inner
runops loop, but for efficiency reasons, perl in fact just sets a flag,
using \f(CW\*(C`CATCH_SET(TRUE)\*(C'\fR. The \f(CW\*(C`pp_require\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`pp_entereval\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`pp_entertry\*(C'\fR ops check this flag, and if true, they call \f(CW\*(C`docatch\*(C'\fR,
which does a \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV_PUSH\*(C'\fR and starts a new runops level to execute the
code, rather than doing it on the current loop.
.Sp
As a further optimisation, on exit from the eval block in the \f(CW\*(C`FETCH\*(C'\fR,
execution of the code following the block is still carried on in the inner
loop.  When an exception is raised, \f(CW\*(C`docatch\*(C'\fR compares the \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV\*(C'\fR
level of the \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR with \f(CW\*(C`PL_top_env\*(C'\fR and if they differ, just
re-throws the exception. In this way any inner loops get popped.
.Sp
Here's an example.
.Sp
.Vb 5
\&    1: eval { tie @a, \*(AqA\*(Aq };
\&    2: sub A::TIEARRAY {
\&    3:     eval { die };
\&    4:     die;
\&    5: }
.Ve
.Sp
To run this code, \f(CW\*(C`perl_run\*(C'\fR is called, which does a \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV_PUSH\*(C'\fR then
enters a runops loop. This loop executes the eval and tie ops on line 1,
with the eval pushing a \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR onto the context stack.
.Sp
The \f(CW\*(C`pp_tie\*(C'\fR does a \f(CW\*(C`CATCH_SET(TRUE)\*(C'\fR, then starts a second runops loop
to execute the body of \f(CW\*(C`TIEARRAY\*(C'\fR. When it executes the entertry op on
line 3, \f(CW\*(C`CATCH_GET\*(C'\fR is true, so \f(CW\*(C`pp_entertry\*(C'\fR calls \f(CW\*(C`docatch\*(C'\fR which
does a \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV_PUSH\*(C'\fR and starts a third runops loop, which then executes
the die op. At this point the C call stack looks like this:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    Perl_pp_die
\&    Perl_runops      # third loop
\&    S_docatch_body
\&    S_docatch
\&    Perl_pp_entertry
\&    Perl_runops      # second loop
\&    S_call_body
\&    Perl_call_sv
\&    Perl_pp_tie
\&    Perl_runops      # first loop
\&    S_run_body
\&    perl_run
\&    main
.Ve
.Sp
and the context and data stacks, as shown by \f(CW\*(C`\-Dstv\*(C'\fR, look like:
.Sp
.Vb 9
\&    STACK 0: MAIN
\&      CX 0: BLOCK  =>
\&      CX 1: EVAL   => AV()  PV("A"\e0)
\&      retop=leave
\&    STACK 1: MAGIC
\&      CX 0: SUB    =>
\&      retop=(null)
\&      CX 1: EVAL   => *
\&    retop=nextstate
.Ve
.Sp
The die pops the first \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR off the context stack, sets
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_restartop\*(C'\fR from it, does a \f(CWJMPENV_JUMP(3)\fR, and control returns to
the top \f(CW\*(C`docatch\*(C'\fR. This then starts another third-level runops level,
which executes the nextstate, pushmark and die ops on line 4. At the point
that the second \f(CW\*(C`pp_die\*(C'\fR is called, the C call stack looks exactly like
that above, even though we are no longer within an inner eval; this is
because of the optimization mentioned earlier. However, the context stack
now looks like this, ie with the top CxEVAL popped:
.Sp
.Vb 7
\&    STACK 0: MAIN
\&      CX 0: BLOCK  =>
\&      CX 1: EVAL   => AV()  PV("A"\e0)
\&      retop=leave
\&    STACK 1: MAGIC
\&      CX 0: SUB    =>
\&      retop=(null)
.Ve
.Sp
The die on line 4 pops the context stack back down to the CxEVAL, leaving
it as:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    STACK 0: MAIN
\&      CX 0: BLOCK  =>
.Ve
.Sp
As usual, \f(CW\*(C`PL_restartop\*(C'\fR is extracted from the \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR, and a
\&\f(CWJMPENV_JUMP(3)\fR done, which pops the C stack back to the docatch:
.Sp
.Vb 10
\&    S_docatch
\&    Perl_pp_entertry
\&    Perl_runops      # second loop
\&    S_call_body
\&    Perl_call_sv
\&    Perl_pp_tie
\&    Perl_runops      # first loop
\&    S_run_body
\&    perl_run
\&    main
.Ve
.Sp
In  this case, because the \f(CW\*(C`JMPENV\*(C'\fR level recorded in the \f(CW\*(C`CxEVAL\*(C'\fR
differs from the current one, \f(CW\*(C`docatch\*(C'\fR just does a \f(CWJMPENV_JUMP(3)\fR
and the C stack unwinds to:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    perl_run
\&    main
.Ve
.Sp
Because \f(CW\*(C`PL_restartop\*(C'\fR is non-null, \f(CW\*(C`run_body\*(C'\fR starts a new runops loop
and execution continues.
.SS "Internal Variable Types"
.IX Subsection "Internal Variable Types"
You should by now have had a look at perlguts, which tells you about
Perl's internal variable types: SVs, HVs, AVs and the rest. If not, do
that now.
.PP
These variables are used not only to represent Perl-space variables, but
also any constants in the code, as well as some structures completely
internal to Perl. The symbol table, for instance, is an ordinary Perl
hash. Your code is represented by an \s-1SV\s0 as it's read into the parser;
any program files you call are opened via ordinary Perl filehandles, and
so on.
.PP
The core Devel::Peek module lets us examine SVs from a
Perl program. Let's see, for instance, how Perl treats the constant
\&\f(CW"hello"\fR.
.PP
.Vb 7
\&      % perl \-MDevel::Peek \-e \*(AqDump("hello")\*(Aq
\&    1 SV = PV(0xa041450) at 0xa04ecbc
\&    2   REFCNT = 1
\&    3   FLAGS = (POK,READONLY,pPOK)
\&    4   PV = 0xa0484e0 "hello"\e0
\&    5   CUR = 5
\&    6   LEN = 6
.Ve
.PP
Reading \f(CW\*(C`Devel::Peek\*(C'\fR output takes a bit of practise, so let's go
through it line by line.
.PP
Line 1 tells us we're looking at an \s-1SV\s0 which lives at \f(CW0xa04ecbc\fR in
memory. SVs themselves are very simple structures, but they contain a
pointer to a more complex structure. In this case, it's a \s-1PV\s0, a
structure which holds a string value, at location \f(CW0xa041450\fR.  Line 2
is the reference count; there are no other references to this data, so
it's 1.
.PP
Line 3 are the flags for this \s-1SV\s0 \- it's \s-1OK\s0 to use it as a \s-1PV\s0, it's a
read-only \s-1SV\s0 (because it's a constant) and the data is a \s-1PV\s0 internally.
Next we've got the contents of the string, starting at location
\&\f(CW0xa0484e0\fR.
.PP
Line 5 gives us the current length of the string \- note that this does
\&\fBnot\fR include the null terminator. Line 6 is not the length of the
string, but the length of the currently allocated buffer; as the string
grows, Perl automatically extends the available storage via a routine
called \f(CW\*(C`SvGROW\*(C'\fR.
.PP
You can get at any of these quantities from C very easily; just add
\&\f(CW\*(C`Sv\*(C'\fR to the name of the field shown in the snippet, and you've got a
macro which will return the value: \f(CW\*(C`SvCUR(sv)\*(C'\fR returns the current
length of the string, \f(CW\*(C`SvREFCOUNT(sv)\*(C'\fR returns the reference count,
\&\f(CW\*(C`SvPV(sv, len)\*(C'\fR returns the string itself with its length, and so on.
More macros to manipulate these properties can be found in perlguts.
.PP
Let's take an example of manipulating a \s-1PV\s0, from \f(CW\*(C`sv_catpvn\*(C'\fR, in \fIsv.c\fR
.PP
.Vb 5
\&     1  void
\&     2  Perl_sv_catpvn(pTHX_ register SV *sv, register const char *ptr, register STRLEN len)
\&     3  {
\&     4      STRLEN tlen;
\&     5      char *junk;
\&
\&     6      junk = SvPV_force(sv, tlen);
\&     7      SvGROW(sv, tlen + len + 1);
\&     8      if (ptr == junk)
\&     9          ptr = SvPVX(sv);
\&    10      Move(ptr,SvPVX(sv)+tlen,len,char);
\&    11      SvCUR(sv) += len;
\&    12      *SvEND(sv) = \*(Aq\e0\*(Aq;
\&    13      (void)SvPOK_only_UTF8(sv);          /* validate pointer */
\&    14      SvTAINT(sv);
\&    15  }
.Ve
.PP
This is a function which adds a string, \f(CW\*(C`ptr\*(C'\fR, of length \f(CW\*(C`len\*(C'\fR onto
the end of the \s-1PV\s0 stored in \f(CW\*(C`sv\*(C'\fR. The first thing we do in line 6 is
make sure that the \s-1SV\s0 \fBhas\fR a valid \s-1PV\s0, by calling the \f(CW\*(C`SvPV_force\*(C'\fR
macro to force a \s-1PV\s0. As a side effect, \f(CW\*(C`tlen\*(C'\fR gets set to the current
value of the \s-1PV\s0, and the \s-1PV\s0 itself is returned to \f(CW\*(C`junk\*(C'\fR.
.PP
In line 7, we make sure that the \s-1SV\s0 will have enough room to accommodate
the old string, the new string and the null terminator. If \f(CW\*(C`LEN\*(C'\fR isn't
big enough, \f(CW\*(C`SvGROW\*(C'\fR will reallocate space for us.
.PP
Now, if \f(CW\*(C`junk\*(C'\fR is the same as the string we're trying to add, we can
grab the string directly from the \s-1SV\s0; \f(CW\*(C`SvPVX\*(C'\fR is the address of the \s-1PV\s0
in the \s-1SV\s0.
.PP
Line 10 does the actual catenation: the \f(CW\*(C`Move\*(C'\fR macro moves a chunk of
memory around: we move the string \f(CW\*(C`ptr\*(C'\fR to the end of the \s-1PV\s0 \- that's
the start of the \s-1PV\s0 plus its current length. We're moving \f(CW\*(C`len\*(C'\fR bytes
of type \f(CW\*(C`char\*(C'\fR. After doing so, we need to tell Perl we've extended the
string, by altering \f(CW\*(C`CUR\*(C'\fR to reflect the new length. \f(CW\*(C`SvEND\*(C'\fR is a
macro which gives us the end of the string, so that needs to be a
\&\f(CW"\e0"\fR.
.PP
Line 13 manipulates the flags; since we've changed the \s-1PV\s0, any \s-1IV\s0 or \s-1NV\s0
values will no longer be valid: if we have \f(CW\*(C`$a=10; $a.="6";\*(C'\fR we don't
want to use the old \s-1IV\s0 of 10. \f(CW\*(C`SvPOK_only_utf8\*(C'\fR is a special UTF\-8\-aware
version of \f(CW\*(C`SvPOK_only\*(C'\fR, a macro which turns off the \s-1IOK\s0 and \s-1NOK\s0 flags
and turns on \s-1POK\s0. The final \f(CW\*(C`SvTAINT\*(C'\fR is a macro which launders tainted
data if taint mode is turned on.
.PP
AVs and HVs are more complicated, but SVs are by far the most common
variable type being thrown around. Having seen something of how we
manipulate these, let's go on and look at how the op tree is
constructed.
.SS "Op Trees"
.IX Subsection "Op Trees"
First, what is the op tree, anyway? The op tree is the parsed
representation of your program, as we saw in our section on parsing, and
it's the sequence of operations that Perl goes through to execute your
program, as we saw in \*(L"Running\*(R".
.PP
An op is a fundamental operation that Perl can perform: all the built-in
functions and operators are ops, and there are a series of ops which
deal with concepts the interpreter needs internally \- entering and
leaving a block, ending a statement, fetching a variable, and so on.
.PP
The op tree is connected in two ways: you can imagine that there are two
\&\*(L"routes\*(R" through it, two orders in which you can traverse the tree.
First, parse order reflects how the parser understood the code, and
secondly, execution order tells perl what order to perform the
operations in.
.PP
The easiest way to examine the op tree is to stop Perl after it has
finished parsing, and get it to dump out the tree. This is exactly what
the compiler backends B::Terse, B::Concise
and B::Debug do.
.PP
Let's have a look at how Perl sees \f(CW\*(C`$a = $b + $c\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 12
\&     % perl \-MO=Terse \-e \*(Aq$a=$b+$c\*(Aq
\&     1  LISTOP (0x8179888) leave
\&     2      OP (0x81798b0) enter
\&     3      COP (0x8179850) nextstate
\&     4      BINOP (0x8179828) sassign

.Ve
.PP
Let's start in the middle, at line 4. This is a \s-1BINOP\s0, a binary
operator, which is at location \f(CW0x8179828\fR. The specific operator in
question is \f(CW\*(C`sassign\*(C'\fR \- scalar assignment \- and you can find the code
which implements it in the function \f(CW\*(C`pp_sassign\*(C'\fR in \fIpp_hot.c\fR. As a
binary operator, it has two children: the add operator, providing the
result of \f(CW\*(C`$b+$c\*(C'\fR, is uppermost on line 5, and the left hand side is on
line 10.
.PP
Line 10 is the null op: this does exactly nothing. What is that doing
there? If you see the null op, it's a sign that something has been
optimized away after parsing. As we mentioned in \*(L"Optimization\*(R",
the optimization stage sometimes converts two operations into one, for
example when fetching a scalar variable. When this happens, instead of
rewriting the op tree and cleaning up the dangling pointers, it's easier
just to replace the redundant operation with the null op. Originally,
the tree would have looked like this:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    10          SVOP (0x816b4f0) rv2sv [15]
\&    11              SVOP (0x816dcf0) gv  GV (0x80fa460) *a
.Ve
.PP
That is, fetch the \f(CW\*(C`a\*(C'\fR entry from the main symbol table, and then look
at the scalar component of it: \f(CW\*(C`gvsv\*(C'\fR (\f(CW\*(C`pp_gvsv\*(C'\fR into \fIpp_hot.c\fR)
happens to do both these things.
.PP
The right hand side, starting at line 5 is similar to what we've just
seen: we have the \f(CW\*(C`add\*(C'\fR op (\f(CW\*(C`pp_add\*(C'\fR also in \fIpp_hot.c\fR) add together
two \f(CW\*(C`gvsv\*(C'\fRs.
.PP
Now, what's this about?
.PP
.Vb 3
\&     1  LISTOP (0x8179888) leave
\&     2      OP (0x81798b0) enter
\&     3      COP (0x8179850) nextstate
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`enter\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`leave\*(C'\fR are scoping ops, and their job is to perform any
housekeeping every time you enter and leave a block: lexical variables
are tidied up, unreferenced variables are destroyed, and so on. Every
program will have those first three lines: \f(CW\*(C`leave\*(C'\fR is a list, and its
children are all the statements in the block. Statements are delimited
by \f(CW\*(C`nextstate\*(C'\fR, so a block is a collection of \f(CW\*(C`nextstate\*(C'\fR ops, with
the ops to be performed for each statement being the children of
\&\f(CW\*(C`nextstate\*(C'\fR. \f(CW\*(C`enter\*(C'\fR is a single op which functions as a marker.
.PP
That's how Perl parsed the program, from top to bottom:
.PP
.Vb 10
\&                        Program
\&                           |
\&                       Statement
\&                           |
\&                           =
\&                          / \e
\&                         /   \e
\&                        $a   +
\&                            / \e
\&                          $b   $c
.Ve
.PP
However, it's impossible to \fBperform\fR the operations in this order:
you have to find the values of \f(CW$b\fR and \f(CW$c\fR before you add them
together, for instance. So, the other thread that runs through the op
tree is the execution order: each op has a field \f(CW\*(C`op_next\*(C'\fR which points
to the next op to be run, so following these pointers tells us how perl
executes the code. We can traverse the tree in this order using
the \f(CW\*(C`exec\*(C'\fR option to \f(CW\*(C`B::Terse\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&     % perl \-MO=Terse,exec \-e \*(Aq$a=$b+$c\*(Aq
\&     1  OP (0x8179928) enter
\&     2  COP (0x81798c8) nextstate
\&     3  SVOP (0x81796c8) gvsv  GV (0x80fa4d4) *b
\&     4  SVOP (0x8179798) gvsv  GV (0x80efeb0) *c
\&     5  BINOP (0x8179878) add [1]
\&     6  SVOP (0x816dd38) gvsv  GV (0x80fa468) *a
\&     7  BINOP (0x81798a0) sassign
\&     8  LISTOP (0x8179900) leave
.Ve
.PP
This probably makes more sense for a human: enter a block, start a
statement. Get the values of \f(CW$b\fR and \f(CW$c\fR, and add them together.
Find \f(CW$a\fR, and assign one to the other. Then leave.
.PP
The way Perl builds up these op trees in the parsing process can be
unravelled by examining \fIperly.y\fR, the \s-1YACC\s0 grammar. Let's take the
piece we need to construct the tree for \f(CW\*(C`$a = $b + $c\*(C'\fR
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    1 term    :   term ASSIGNOP term
\&    2                { $$ = newASSIGNOP(OPf_STACKED, $1, $2, $3); }
\&    3         |   term ADDOP term
\&    4                { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }
.Ve
.PP
If you're not used to reading \s-1BNF\s0 grammars, this is how it works: You're
fed certain things by the tokeniser, which generally end up in upper
case. Here, \f(CW\*(C`ADDOP\*(C'\fR, is provided when the tokeniser sees \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR in your
code. \f(CW\*(C`ASSIGNOP\*(C'\fR is provided when \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR is used for assigning. These are
\&\*(L"terminal symbols\*(R", because you can't get any simpler than them.
.PP
The grammar, lines one and three of the snippet above, tells you how to
build up more complex forms. These complex forms, \*(L"non-terminal symbols\*(R"
are generally placed in lower case. \f(CW\*(C`term\*(C'\fR here is a non-terminal
symbol, representing a single expression.
.PP
The grammar gives you the following rule: you can make the thing on the
left of the colon if you see all the things on the right in sequence.
This is called a \*(L"reduction\*(R", and the aim of parsing is to completely
reduce the input. There are several different ways you can perform a
reduction, separated by vertical bars: so, \f(CW\*(C`term\*(C'\fR followed by \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR
followed by \f(CW\*(C`term\*(C'\fR makes a \f(CW\*(C`term\*(C'\fR, and \f(CW\*(C`term\*(C'\fR followed by \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR
followed by \f(CW\*(C`term\*(C'\fR can also make a \f(CW\*(C`term\*(C'\fR.
.PP
So, if you see two terms with an \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, between them, you can
turn them into a single expression. When you do this, you execute the
code in the block on the next line: if you see \f(CW\*(C`=\*(C'\fR, you'll do the code
in line 2. If you see \f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR, you'll do the code in line 4. It's this code
which contributes to the op tree.
.PP
.Vb 2
\&            |   term ADDOP term
\&            { $$ = newBINOP($2, 0, scalar($1), scalar($3)); }
.Ve
.PP
What this does is creates a new binary op, and feeds it a number of
variables. The variables refer to the tokens: \f(CW$1\fR is the first token in
the input, \f(CW$2\fR the second, and so on \- think regular expression
backreferences. \f(CW$$\fR is the op returned from this reduction. So, we
call \f(CW\*(C`newBINOP\*(C'\fR to create a new binary operator. The first parameter to
\&\f(CW\*(C`newBINOP\*(C'\fR, a function in \fIop.c\fR, is the op type. It's an addition
operator, so we want the type to be \f(CW\*(C`ADDOP\*(C'\fR. We could specify this
directly, but it's right there as the second token in the input, so we
use \f(CW$2\fR. The second parameter is the op's flags: 0 means \*(L"nothing
special\*(R". Then the things to add: the left and right hand side of our
expression, in scalar context.
.SS "Stacks"
.IX Subsection "Stacks"
When perl executes something like \f(CW\*(C`addop\*(C'\fR, how does it pass on its
results to the next op? The answer is, through the use of stacks. Perl
has a number of stacks to store things it's currently working on, and
we'll look at the three most important ones here.
.IP "Argument stack" 3
.IX Item "Argument stack"
Arguments are passed to \s-1PP\s0 code and returned from \s-1PP\s0 code using the
argument stack, \f(CW\*(C`ST\*(C'\fR. The typical way to handle arguments is to pop
them off the stack, deal with them how you wish, and then push the result
back onto the stack. This is how, for instance, the cosine operator
works:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&      NV value;
\&      value = POPn;
\&      value = Perl_cos(value);
\&      XPUSHn(value);
.Ve
.Sp
We'll see a more tricky example of this when we consider Perl's macros
below. \f(CW\*(C`POPn\*(C'\fR gives you the \s-1NV\s0 (floating point value) of the top \s-1SV\s0 on
the stack: the \f(CW$x\fR in \f(CW\*(C`cos($x)\*(C'\fR. Then we compute the cosine, and push
the result back as an \s-1NV\s0. The \f(CW\*(C`X\*(C'\fR in \f(CW\*(C`XPUSHn\*(C'\fR means that the stack
should be extended if necessary \- it can't be necessary here, because we
know there's room for one more item on the stack, since we've just
removed one! The \f(CW\*(C`XPUSH*\*(C'\fR macros at least guarantee safety.
.Sp
Alternatively, you can fiddle with the stack directly: \f(CW\*(C`SP\*(C'\fR gives you
the first element in your portion of the stack, and \f(CW\*(C`TOP*\*(C'\fR gives you
the top SV/IV/NV/etc. on the stack. So, for instance, to do unary
negation of an integer:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     SETi(\-TOPi);
.Ve
.Sp
Just set the integer value of the top stack entry to its negation.
.Sp
Argument stack manipulation in the core is exactly the same as it is in
XSUBs \- see perlxstut, perlxs and perlguts for a longer
description of the macros used in stack manipulation.
.IP "Mark stack" 3
.IX Item "Mark stack"
I say \*(L"your portion of the stack\*(R" above because \s-1PP\s0 code doesn't
necessarily get the whole stack to itself: if your function calls
another function, you'll only want to expose the arguments aimed for the
called function, and not (necessarily) let it get at your own data. The
way we do this is to have a \*(L"virtual\*(R" bottom-of-stack, exposed to each
function. The mark stack keeps bookmarks to locations in the argument
stack usable by each function. For instance, when dealing with a tied
variable, (internally, something with \*(L"P\*(R" magic) Perl has to call
methods for accesses to the tied variables. However, we need to separate
the arguments exposed to the method to the argument exposed to the
original function \- the store or fetch or whatever it may be. Here's
roughly how the tied \f(CW\*(C`push\*(C'\fR is implemented; see \f(CW\*(C`av_push\*(C'\fR in \fIav.c\fR:
.Sp
.Vb 8
\&     1  PUSHMARK(SP);
\&     2  EXTEND(SP,2);
\&     3  PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg));
\&     4  PUSHs(val);
\&     5  PUTBACK;
\&     6  ENTER;
\&     7  call_method("PUSH", G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD);
\&     8  LEAVE;
.Ve
.Sp
Let's examine the whole implementation, for practice:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     1  PUSHMARK(SP);
.Ve
.Sp
Push the current state of the stack pointer onto the mark stack. This is
so that when we've finished adding items to the argument stack, Perl
knows how many things we've added recently.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&     2  EXTEND(SP,2);
\&     3  PUSHs(SvTIED_obj((SV*)av, mg));
\&     4  PUSHs(val);
.Ve
.Sp
We're going to add two more items onto the argument stack: when you have
a tied array, the \f(CW\*(C`PUSH\*(C'\fR subroutine receives the object and the value
to be pushed, and that's exactly what we have here \- the tied object,
retrieved with \f(CW\*(C`SvTIED_obj\*(C'\fR, and the value, the \s-1SV\s0 \f(CW\*(C`val\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&     5  PUTBACK;
.Ve
.Sp
Next we tell Perl to update the global stack pointer from our internal
variable: \f(CW\*(C`dSP\*(C'\fR only gave us a local copy, not a reference to the global.
.Sp
.Vb 3
\&     6  ENTER;
\&     7  call_method("PUSH", G_SCALAR|G_DISCARD);
\&     8  LEAVE;
.Ve
.Sp
\&\f(CW\*(C`ENTER\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`LEAVE\*(C'\fR localise a block of code \- they make sure that all
variables are tidied up, everything that has been localised gets
its previous value returned, and so on. Think of them as the \f(CW\*(C`{\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`}\*(C'\fR of a Perl block.
.Sp
To actually do the magic method call, we have to call a subroutine in
Perl space: \f(CW\*(C`call_method\*(C'\fR takes care of that, and it's described in
perlcall. We call the \f(CW\*(C`PUSH\*(C'\fR method in scalar context, and we're
going to discard its return value.  The \fIcall_method()\fR function
removes the top element of the mark stack, so there is nothing for
the caller to clean up.
.IP "Save stack" 3
.IX Item "Save stack"
C doesn't have a concept of local scope, so perl provides one. We've
seen that \f(CW\*(C`ENTER\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`LEAVE\*(C'\fR are used as scoping braces; the save
stack implements the C equivalent of, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&    {
\&        local $foo = 42;
\&        ...
\&    }
.Ve
.Sp
See \*(L"Localising Changes\*(R" in perlguts for how to use the save stack.
.SS "Millions of Macros"
.IX Subsection "Millions of Macros"
One thing you'll notice about the Perl source is that it's full of
macros. Some have called the pervasive use of macros the hardest thing
to understand, others find it adds to clarity. Let's take an example,
the code which implements the addition operator:
.PP
.Vb 9
\&   1  PP(pp_add)
\&   2  {
\&   3      dSP; dATARGET; tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN);
\&   4      {
\&   5        dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
\&   6        SETn( left + right );
\&   7        RETURN;
\&   8      }
\&   9  }
.Ve
.PP
Every line here (apart from the braces, of course) contains a macro. The
first line sets up the function declaration as Perl expects for \s-1PP\s0 code;
line 3 sets up variable declarations for the argument stack and the
target, the return value of the operation. Finally, it tries to see if
the addition operation is overloaded; if so, the appropriate subroutine
is called.
.PP
Line 5 is another variable declaration \- all variable declarations start
with \f(CW\*(C`d\*(C'\fR \- which pops from the top of the argument stack two NVs (hence
\&\f(CW\*(C`nn\*(C'\fR) and puts them into the variables \f(CW\*(C`right\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`left\*(C'\fR, hence the
\&\f(CW\*(C`rl\*(C'\fR. These are the two operands to the addition operator. Next, we
call \f(CW\*(C`SETn\*(C'\fR to set the \s-1NV\s0 of the return value to the result of adding
the two values. This done, we return \- the \f(CW\*(C`RETURN\*(C'\fR macro makes sure
that our return value is properly handled, and we pass the next operator
to run back to the main run loop.
.PP
Most of these macros are explained in perlapi, and some of the more
important ones are explained in perlxs as well. Pay special attention
to \*(L"Background and \s-1PERL_IMPLICIT_CONTEXT\s0\*(R" in perlguts for information on
the \f(CW\*(C`[pad]THX_?\*(C'\fR macros.
.SS "The .i Targets"

Though much can be written about the inconsistency and coverage
problems of gcc warnings (like \f(CW\*(C`\-Wall\*(C'\fR not meaning \*(L"all the

\&\f(CW\*(C`\-Wall\*(C'\fR, or \f(CW\*(C`\-ansi\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`\-pedantic\*(C'\fR both being a poorly defined
collection of warnings, and so forth), gcc is still a useful tool in
keeping our coding nose clean.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-Wall\*(C'\fR is by default on.
.PP
The \f(CW\*(C`\-ansi\*(C'\fR (and its sidekick, \f(CW\*(C`\-pedantic\*(C'\fR) would be nice to be on
always, but unfortunately they are not safe on all platforms, they can
for example cause fatal conflicts with the system headers (Solaris
being a prime example).  If Configure \f(CW\*(C`\-Dgccansipedantic\*(C'\fR is used,
the \f(CW\*(C`cflags\*(C'\fR frontend selects \f(CW\*(C`\-ansi \-pedantic\*(C'\fR for the platforms
where they are known to be safe.
.PP
Starting from Perl 5.9.4 the following extra flags are added:

The \f(CW\*(C`\-Wtraditional\*(C'\fR is another example of the annoying tendency of
gcc to bundle a lot of warnings under one switch (it would be
impossible to deploy in practice because it would complain a lot) but
it does contain some warnings that would be beneficial to have available
on their own, such as the warning about string constants inside macros
containing the macro arguments: this behaved differently pre-ANSI
than it does in \s-1ANSI\s0, and some C compilers are still in transition,
\&\s-1AIX\s0 being an example.
.SS "Warnings of other C compilers"

happened, or how did we end up having wrong or unexpected results.
.SS "Poking at Perl"

If the debugging output of \f(CW\*(C`\-D\*(C'\fR doesn't help you, it's time to step
through perl's execution with a source-level debugger.
.IP "\(bu" 3
We'll use \f(CW\*(C`gdb\*(C'\fR for our examples here; the principles will apply to
any debugger (many vendors call their debugger \f(CW\*(C`dbx\*(C'\fR), but check the
manual of the one you're using.
.PP
To fire up the debugger, type
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    gdb ./perl

Or if you have a core dump:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    gdb ./perl core

recursively apply those macros for you.
.SS "gdb macro support"
.IX Subsection "gdb macro support"
Recent versions of \fIgdb\fR have fairly good macro support, but
in order to use it you'll need to compile perl with macro definitions
included in the debugging information.  Using \fIgcc\fR version 3.1, this
means configuring with \f(CW\*(C`\-Doptimize=\-g3\*(C'\fR.  Other compilers might use a
different switch (if they support debugging macros at all).
.SS "Dumping Perl Data Structures"
.IX Subsection "Dumping Perl Data Structures"
One way to get around this macro hell is to use the dumping functions in
\&\fIdump.c\fR; these work a little like an internal
Devel::Peek, but they also cover OPs and other structures
that you can't get at from Perl. Let's take an example. We'll use the
\&\f(CW\*(C`$a = $b + $c\*(C'\fR we used before, but give it a bit of context:
\&\f(CW\*(C`$b = "6XXXX"; $c = 2.3;\*(C'\fR. Where's a good place to stop and poke around?
.PP
What about \f(CW\*(C`pp_add\*(C'\fR, the function we examined earlier to implement the
\&\f(CW\*(C`+\*(C'\fR operator:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    (gdb) break Perl_pp_add
\&    Breakpoint 1 at 0x46249f: file pp_hot.c, line 309.
.Ve
.PP
Notice we use \f(CW\*(C`Perl_pp_add\*(C'\fR and not \f(CW\*(C`pp_add\*(C'\fR \- see \*(L"Internal Functions\*(R" in perlguts.
With the breakpoint in place, we can run our program:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    (gdb) run \-e \*(Aq$b = "6XXXX"; $c = 2.3; $a = $b + $c\*(Aq
.Ve
.PP
Lots of junk will go past as gdb reads in the relevant source files and
libraries, and then:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    Breakpoint 1, Perl_pp_add () at pp_hot.c:309
\&    309         dSP; dATARGET; tryAMAGICbin(add,opASSIGN);
\&    (gdb) step
\&    311           dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
\&    (gdb)
.Ve
.PP
We looked at this bit of code before, and we said that \f(CW\*(C`dPOPTOPnnrl_ul\*(C'\fR
arranges for two \f(CW\*(C`NV\*(C'\fRs to be placed into \f(CW\*(C`left\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`right\*(C'\fR \- let's
slightly expand it:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& #define dPOPTOPnnrl_ul  NV right = POPn; \e
\&                         SV *leftsv = TOPs; \e
\&                         NV left = USE_LEFT(leftsv) ? SvNV(leftsv) : 0.0
.Ve
.PP
\&\f(CW\*(C`POPn\*(C'\fR takes the \s-1SV\s0 from the top of the stack and obtains its \s-1NV\s0 either
directly (if \f(CW\*(C`SvNOK\*(C'\fR is set) or by calling the \f(CW\*(C`sv_2nv\*(C'\fR function.
\&\f(CW\*(C`TOPs\*(C'\fR takes the next \s-1SV\s0 from the top of the stack \- yes, \f(CW\*(C`POPn\*(C'\fR uses
\&\f(CW\*(C`TOPs\*(C'\fR \- but doesn't remove it. We then use \f(CW\*(C`SvNV\*(C'\fR to get the \s-1NV\s0 from
\&\f(CW\*(C`leftsv\*(C'\fR in the same way as before \- yes, \f(CW\*(C`POPn\*(C'\fR uses \f(CW\*(C`SvNV\*(C'\fR.
.PP
Since we don't have an \s-1NV\s0 for \f(CW$b\fR, we'll have to use \f(CW\*(C`sv_2nv\*(C'\fR to
convert it. If we step again, we'll find ourselves there:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    Perl_sv_2nv (sv=0xa0675d0) at sv.c:1669
\&    1669        if (!sv)
\&    (gdb)
.Ve
.PP
We can now use \f(CW\*(C`Perl_sv_dump\*(C'\fR to investigate the \s-1SV:\s0
.PP
.Vb 7

\&    PV = 0xa06a510 "6XXXX"\e0
\&    CUR = 5
\&    LEN = 6
\&    $1 = void
.Ve
.PP
We know we're going to get \f(CW6\fR from this, so let's finish the
subroutine:
.PP

\&    311           dPOPTOPnnrl_ul;
.Ve
.PP
We can also dump out this op: the current op is always stored in
\&\f(CW\*(C`PL_op\*(C'\fR, and we can dump it with \f(CW\*(C`Perl_op_dump\*(C'\fR. This'll give us
similar output to B::Debug.

.SS "Patching"
.IX Subsection "Patching"
All right, we've now had a look at how to navigate the Perl sources and
some things you'll need to know when fiddling with them. Let's now get
on and create a simple patch. Here's something Larry suggested: if a
\&\f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR is the first active format during a \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR, (for example,
\&\f(CW\*(C`pack "U3C8", @stuff\*(C'\fR) then the resulting string should be treated as
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 encoded.
.PP
If you are working with a git clone of the Perl repository, you will want to
create a branch for your changes. This will make creating a proper patch much
simpler. See the perlrepository for details on how to do this.
.PP
How do we prepare to fix this up? First we locate the code in question \-
the \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR happens at runtime, so it's going to be in one of the \fIpp\fR
files. Sure enough, \f(CW\*(C`pp_pack\*(C'\fR is in \fIpp.c\fR. Since we're going to be
altering this file, let's copy it to \fIpp.c~\fR.
.PP
[Well, it was in \fIpp.c\fR when this tutorial was written. It has now been
split off with \f(CW\*(C`pp_unpack\*(C'\fR to its own file, \fIpp_pack.c\fR]
.PP
Now let's look over \f(CW\*(C`pp_pack\*(C'\fR: we take a pattern into \f(CW\*(C`pat\*(C'\fR, and then
loop over the pattern, taking each format character in turn into
\&\f(CW\*(C`datum_type\*(C'\fR. Then for each possible format character, we swallow up
the other arguments in the pattern (a field width, an asterisk, and so
on) and convert the next chunk input into the specified format, adding
it onto the output \s-1SV\s0 \f(CW\*(C`cat\*(C'\fR.
.PP
How do we know if the \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR is the first format in the \f(CW\*(C`pat\*(C'\fR? Well, if
we have a pointer to the start of \f(CW\*(C`pat\*(C'\fR then, if we see a \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR we can
test whether we're still at the start of the string. So, here's where
\&\f(CW\*(C`pat\*(C'\fR is set up:
.PP
.Vb 6
\&    STRLEN fromlen;
\&    register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK, fromlen);
\&    register char *patend = pat + fromlen;
\&    register I32 len;
\&    I32 datumtype;
\&    SV *fromstr;
.Ve
.PP
We'll have another string pointer in there:
.PP
.Vb 7
\&    STRLEN fromlen;
\&    register char *pat = SvPVx(*++MARK, fromlen);
\&    register char *patend = pat + fromlen;
\& +  char *patcopy;
\&    register I32 len;
\&    I32 datumtype;
\&    SV *fromstr;
.Ve
.PP
And just before we start the loop, we'll set \f(CW\*(C`patcopy\*(C'\fR to be the start
of \f(CW\*(C`pat\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 5
\&    items = SP \- MARK;
\&    MARK++;
\&    sv_setpvn(cat, "", 0);
\& +  patcopy = pat;
\&    while (pat < patend) {
.Ve
.PP
Now if we see a \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR which was at the start of the string, we turn on
the \f(CW\*(C`UTF8\*(C'\fR flag for the output \s-1SV\s0, \f(CW\*(C`cat\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 5
\& +  if (datumtype == \*(AqU\*(Aq && pat==patcopy+1)
\& +      SvUTF8_on(cat);
\&    if (datumtype == \*(Aq#\*(Aq) {
\&        while (pat < patend && *pat != \*(Aq\en\*(Aq)
\&            pat++;
.Ve
.PP
Remember that it has to be \f(CW\*(C`patcopy+1\*(C'\fR because the first character of
the string is the \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR which has been swallowed into \f(CW\*(C`datumtype!\*(C'\fR
.PP
Oops, we forgot one thing: what if there are spaces at the start of the
pattern? \f(CW\*(C`pack("  U*", @stuff)\*(C'\fR will have \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR as the first active
character, even though it's not the first thing in the pattern. In this
case, we have to advance \f(CW\*(C`patcopy\*(C'\fR along with \f(CW\*(C`pat\*(C'\fR when we see spaces:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    if (isSPACE(datumtype))
\&        continue;
.Ve
.PP
needs to become
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    if (isSPACE(datumtype)) {
\&        patcopy++;
\&        continue;
\&    }
.Ve
.PP
\&\s-1OK\s0. That's the C part done. Now we must do two additional things before
this patch is ready to go: we've changed the behaviour of Perl, and so
we must document that change. We must also provide some more regression
tests to make sure our patch works and doesn't create a bug somewhere
else along the line.
.PP
The regression tests for each operator live in \fIt/op/\fR, and so we
make a copy of \fIt/op/pack.t\fR to \fIt/op/pack.t~\fR. Now we can add our
tests to the end. First, we'll test that the \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR does indeed create
Unicode strings.
.PP
t/op/pack.t has a sensible \fIok()\fR function, but if it didn't we could
use the one from t/test.pl.
.PP
.Vb 2
\& require \*(Aq./test.pl\*(Aq;
\& plan( tests => 159 );
.Ve
.PP
so instead of this:
.PP
.Vb 3
\& print \*(Aqnot \*(Aq unless "1.20.300.4000" eq sprintf "%vd",
\&                                               pack("U*",1,20,300,4000);
\& print "ok $test\en"; $test++;
.Ve
.PP
we can write the more sensible (see Test::More for a full
explanation of \fIis()\fR and other testing functions).
.PP
.Vb 2
\& is( "1.20.300.4000", sprintf "%vd", pack("U*",1,20,300,4000),
\&                                       "U* produces Unicode" );
.Ve
.PP
Now we'll test that we got that space-at-the-beginning business right:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& is( "1.20.300.4000", sprintf "%vd", pack("  U*",1,20,300,4000),
\&                                     "  with spaces at the beginning" );
.Ve
.PP
And finally we'll test that we don't make Unicode strings if \f(CW\*(C`U\*(C'\fR is \fBnot\fR
the first active format:
.PP
.Vb 2
\& isnt( v1.20.300.4000, sprintf "%vd", pack("C0U*",1,20,300,4000),
\&                                       "U* not first isn\*(Aqt Unicode" );
.Ve
.PP
Mustn't forget to change the number of tests which appears at the top,
or else the automated tester will get confused.  This will either look
like this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& print "1..156\en";
.Ve
.PP
or this:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& plan( tests => 156 );
.Ve
.PP
We now compile up Perl, and run it through the test suite. Our new
tests pass, hooray!
.PP
Finally, the documentation. The job is never done until the paperwork is
over, so let's describe the change we've just made. The relevant place
is \fIpod/perlfunc.pod\fR; again, we make a copy, and then we'll insert
this text in the description of \f(CW\*(C`pack\*(C'\fR:
.PP
.Vb 1
\& =item *
\&
\& If the pattern begins with a C<U>, the resulting string will be treated
\& as UTF\-8\-encoded Unicode. You can force UTF\-8 encoding on in a string
\& with an initial C<U0>, and the bytes that follow will be interpreted as
\& Unicode characters. If you don\*(Aqt want this to happen, you can begin
\& your pattern with C<C0> (or anything else) to force Perl not to UTF\-8
\& encode your string, and then follow this with a C<U*> somewhere in your
\& pattern.
.Ve
.SS "Patching a core module"
.IX Subsection "Patching a core module"
This works just like patching anything else, with an extra
consideration.  Many core modules also live on \s-1CPAN\s0.  If this is so,
patch the \s-1CPAN\s0 version instead of the core and send the patch off to
the module maintainer (with a copy to p5p).  This will help the module
maintainer keep the \s-1CPAN\s0 version in sync with the core version without
constantly scanning p5p.
.PP
The list of maintainers of core modules is usefully documented in
\&\fIPorting/Maintainers.pl\fR.
.SS "Adding a new function to the core"
.IX Subsection "Adding a new function to the core"
If, as part of a patch to fix a bug, or just because you have an
especially good idea, you decide to add a new function to the core,
discuss your ideas on p5p well before you start work.  It may be that
someone else has already attempted to do what you are considering and
can give lots of good advice or even provide you with bits of code
that they already started (but never finished).
.PP
You have to follow all of the advice given above for patching.  It is
extremely important to test any addition thoroughly and add new tests
to explore all boundary conditions that your new function is expected
to handle.  If your new function is used only by one module (e.g. toke),
then it should probably be named S_your_function (for static); on the
other hand, if you expect it to accessible from other functions in
Perl, you should name it Perl_your_function.  See \*(L"Internal Functions\*(R" in perlguts
for more details.
.PP
The location of any new code is also an important consideration.  Don't
just create a new top level .c file and put your code there; you would
have to make changes to Configure (so the Makefile is created properly),
as well as possibly lots of include files.  This is strictly pumpking
business.
.PP
It is better to add your function to one of the existing top level
source code files, but your choice is complicated by the nature of
the Perl distribution.  Only the files that are marked as compiled
static are located in the perl executable.  Everything else is located
in the shared library (or \s-1DLL\s0 if you are running under \s-1WIN32\s0).  So,
for example, if a function was only used by functions located in
toke.c, then your code can go in toke.c.  If, however, you want to call
the function from universal.c, then you should put your code in another
location, for example util.c.
.PP
In addition to writing your c\-code, you will need to create an
appropriate entry in embed.pl describing your function, then run
\&'make regen_headers' to create the entries in the numerous header
files that perl needs to compile correctly.  See \*(L"Internal Functions\*(R" in perlguts
for information on the various options that you can set in embed.pl.
You will forget to do this a few (or many) times and you will get
warnings during the compilation phase.  Make sure that you mention
this when you post your patch to P5P; the pumpking needs to know this.
.PP
When you write your new code, please be conscious of existing code
conventions used in the perl source files.  See perlstyle for
details.  Although most of the guidelines discussed seem to focus on
Perl code, rather than c, they all apply (except when they don't ;).
Also see perlrepository for lots of details about both formatting and
submitting patches of your changes.
.PP
Lastly, \s-1TEST\s0 \s-1TEST\s0 \s-1TEST\s0 \s-1TEST\s0 \s-1TEST\s0 any code before posting to p5p.
Test on as many platforms as you can find.  Test as many perl
Configure options as you can (e.g. \s-1MULTIPLICITY\s0).  If you have
profiling or memory tools, see \*(L"\s-1EXTERNAL\s0 \s-1TOOLS\s0 \s-1FOR\s0 \s-1DEBUGGING\s0 \s-1PERL\s0\*(R"
below for how to use them to further test your code.  Remember that
most of the people on P5P are doing this on their own time and
don't have the time to debug your code.
.SS "Writing a test"
.IX Subsection "Writing a test"
Every module and built-in function has an associated test file (or
should...).  If you add or change functionality, you have to write a
test.  If you fix a bug, you have to write a test so that bug never
comes back.  If you alter the docs, it would be nice to test what the
new documentation says.
.PP
In short, if you submit a patch you probably also have to patch the
tests.

t/test.pl and ad hoc \f(CW\*(C`print $test ? "ok 42\en" : "not ok 42\en"\*(C'\fR.  The
decision of which to use depends on what part of the test suite you're

Now that the core of Perl is tested, Test::More can be used.  You can

When you say \*(L"make test\*(R" Perl uses the \fIt/TEST\fR program to run the
test suite (except under Win32 where it uses \fIt/harness\fR instead.)
All tests are run from the \fIt/\fR directory, \fBnot\fR the directory
which contains the test.  This causes some problems with the tests
in \fIlib/\fR, so here's some opportunity for some patching.
.PP
You must be triply conscious of cross-platform concerns.  This usually
boils down to using File::Spec and avoiding things like \f(CW\*(C`fork()\*(C'\fR and
\&\f(CW\*(C`system()\*(C'\fR unless absolutely necessary.

.IX Item "test_harness"
Run the test suite with the \fIt/harness\fR controlling program, instead of

Test::Harness module, thus using this test target supposes that perl
mostly works. The main advantage for our purposes is that it prints a
detailed summary of failed tests at the end. Also, unlike \fIt/TEST\fR, it
doesn't redirect stderr to stdout.

Under Win32's \*(L"test\*(R" target you may use the \s-1TEST_SWITCHES\s0 and \s-1TEST_FILES\s0

The core distribution can now run its regression tests in parallel on
Unix-like platforms. Instead of running \f(CW\*(C`make test\*(C'\fR, set \f(CW\*(C`TEST_JOBS\*(C'\fR in
your environment to the number of tests to run in parallel, and run
\&\f(CW\*(C`make test_harness\*(C'\fR. On a Bourne-like shell, this can be done as
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&    TEST_JOBS=3 make test_harness  # Run 3 tests in parallel
.Ve
.Sp
An environment variable is used, rather than parallel make itself, because
TAP::Harness needs to be able to schedule individual non-conflicting test
scripts itself, and there is no standard interface to \f(CW\*(C`make\*(C'\fR utilities to
interact with their job schedulers.
.Sp
Note that currently some test scripts may fail when run in parallel (most

Not compiling with threading
.Sp
Compiling with threading (\-Duseithreads) completely rewrites
the function prototypes of Perl.  You better try your changes
with that.  Related to this is the difference between \*(L"Perl_\-less\*(R"
and \*(L"Perl_\-ly\*(R" APIs, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  Perl_sv_setiv(aTHX_ ...);
\&  sv_setiv(...);
.Ve
.Sp
The first one explicitly passes in the context, which is needed for e.g.
threaded builds.  The second one does that implicitly; do not get them
mixed.  If you are not passing in a aTHX_, you will need to do a dTHX
(or a dVAR) as the first thing in the function.
.Sp
See \*(L"How multiple interpreters and concurrency are supported\*(R" in perlguts
for further discussion about context.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Not compiling with \-DDEBUGGING

The \s-1DEBUGGING\s0 define exposes more code to the compiler,

Introducing (non-read-only) globals
.Sp
Do not introduce any modifiable globals, truly global or file static.
They are bad form and complicate multithreading and other forms of
concurrency.  The right way is to introduce them as new interpreter
variables, see \fIintrpvar.h\fR (at the very end for binary compatibility).
.Sp
Introducing read-only (const) globals is okay, as long as you verify
with e.g. \f(CW\*(C`nm libperl.a|egrep \-v \*(Aq [TURtr] \*(Aq\*(C'\fR (if your \f(CW\*(C`nm\*(C'\fR has
BSD-style output) that the data you added really is read-only.
(If it is, it shouldn't show up in the output of that command.)
.Sp
If you want to have static strings, make them constant:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  static const char etc[] = "...";
.Ve
.Sp
If you want to have arrays of constant strings, note carefully
the right combination of \f(CW\*(C`const\*(C'\fRs:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&    static const char * const yippee[] =
\&        {"hi", "ho", "silver"};

There is a way to completely hide any modifiable globals (they are all
moved to heap), the compilation setting \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_GLOBAL_STRUCT_PRIVATE\*(C'\fR.

Not exporting your new function
.Sp
Some platforms (Win32, \s-1AIX\s0, \s-1VMS\s0, \s-1OS/2\s0, to name a few) require any
function that is part of the public \s-1API\s0 (the shared Perl library)

.IP "\(bu" 4
Exporting your new function
.Sp
The new shiny result of either genuine new functionality or your
arduous refactoring is now ready and correctly exported.  So what
could possibly go wrong?
.Sp
Maybe simply that your function did not need to be exported in the
first place.  Perl has a long and not so glorious history of exporting
functions that it should not have.
.Sp
If the function is used only inside one source code file, make it
static.  See the discussion about \fIembed.pl\fR in perlguts.
.Sp
If the function is used across several files, but intended only for
Perl's internal use (and this should be the common case), do not
export it to the public \s-1API\s0.  See the discussion about \fIembed.pl\fR
in perlguts.

oneself from public embarrassment.
.PP
If using gcc, you can add the \f(CW\*(C`\-std=c89\*(C'\fR option which will hopefully
catch most of these unportabilities. (However it might also catch
incompatibilities in your system's header files.)
.PP
Use the Configure \f(CW\*(C`\-Dgccansipedantic\*(C'\fR flag to enable the gcc

.PP
Note that if using gcc, starting from Perl 5.9.5 the Perl core source
code files (the ones at the top level of the source code distribution,
but not e.g. the extensions under ext/) are automatically compiled
with as many as possible of the \f(CW\*(C`\-std=c89\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-ansi\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-pedantic\*(C'\fR,

Assuming the character set is ASCIIish
.Sp
Perl can compile and run under \s-1EBCDIC\s0 platforms.  See perlebcdic.
This is transparent for the most part, but because the character sets
differ, you shouldn't use numeric (decimal, octal, nor hex) constants
to refer to characters.  You can safely say 'A', but not 0x41.
You can safely say '\en', but not \e012.
If a character doesn't have a trivial input form, you can
create a #define for it in both \f(CW\*(C`utfebcdic.h\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`utf8.h\*(C'\fR, so that
it resolves to different values depending on the character set being used.
(There are three different \s-1EBCDIC\s0 character sets defined in \f(CW\*(C`utfebcdic.h\*(C'\fR,
so it might be best to insert the #define three times in that file.)
.Sp
Also, the range 'A' \- 'Z' in \s-1ASCII\s0 is an unbroken sequence of 26 upper case
alphabetic characters.  That is not true in \s-1EBCDIC\s0.  Nor for 'a' to 'z'.
But '0' \- '9' is an unbroken range in both systems.  Don't assume anything
about other ranges.
.Sp
Many of the comments in the existing code ignore the possibility of \s-1EBCDIC\s0,
and may be wrong therefore, even if the code works.
This is actually a tribute to the successful transparent insertion of being
able to handle \s-1EBCDIC\s0 without having to change pre-existing code.
.Sp
\&\s-1UTF\-8\s0 and UTF-EBCDIC are two different encodings used to represent Unicode
code points as sequences of bytes.  Macros 
with the same names (but different definitions)
in \f(CW\*(C`utf8.h\*(C'\fR and \f(CW\*(C`utfebcdic.h\*(C'\fR
are used to allow the calling code to think that there is only one such
encoding.
This is almost always referred to as \f(CW\*(C`utf8\*(C'\fR, but it means the \s-1EBCDIC\s0 version
as well.  Again, comments in the code may well be wrong even if the code itself
is right.
For example, the concept of \f(CW\*(C`invariant characters\*(C'\fR differs between \s-1ASCII\s0 and
\&\s-1EBCDIC\s0.
On \s-1ASCII\s0 platforms, only characters that do not have the high-order
bit set (i.e. whose ordinals are strict \s-1ASCII\s0, 0 \- 127)
are invariant, and the documentation and comments in the code
may assume that,
often referring to something like, say, \f(CW\*(C`hibit\*(C'\fR.
The situation differs and is not so simple on \s-1EBCDIC\s0 machines, but as long as
the code itself uses the \f(CW\*(C`NATIVE_IS_INVARIANT()\*(C'\fR macro appropriately, it
works, even if the comments are wrong.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Assuming the character set is just \s-1ASCII\s0
.Sp
\&\s-1ASCII\s0 is a 7 bit encoding, but bytes have 8 bits in them.  The 128 extra

currently these extra characters are generally considered to be unassigned,

This is being changed starting in 5.12 so that these characters will
be considered to be Latin\-1 (\s-1ISO\-8859\-1\s0).

fatal in at least one platform: for example \s-1VMS\s0 cc considers this a
fatal error.  One cause for people often making this mistake is that a
\&\*(L"naked char\*(R" and therefore dereferencing a \*(L"naked char pointer\*(R" have
an undefined signedness: it depends on the compiler and the flags of
the compiler and the underlying platform whether the result is signed
or unsigned.  For this very same reason using a 'char' as an array
index is bad.

Macros that have string constants and their arguments as substrings of

Pre-ANSI semantics for that was equivalent to

which is probably not what you were expecting.  Unfortunately at least
one reasonably common and modern C compiler does \*(L"real backward

Using printf formats for non-basic C types

While this might by accident work in some platform (where \s-1IV\s0 happens
to be an \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR), in general it cannot.  \s-1IV\s0 might be something larger.
Even worse the situation is with more specific types (defined by Perl's
configuration step in \fIconfig.h\fR):
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   Uid_t who = ...;
\&   printf("who = %d\en", who);    /* BAD */
.Ve
.Sp
The problem here is that Uid_t might be not only not \f(CW\*(C`int\*(C'\fR\-wide
but it might also be unsigned, in which case large uids would be
printed as negative values.
.Sp
There is no simple solution to this because of \fIprintf()\fR's limited
intelligence, but for many types the right format is available as
with either 'f' or '_f' suffix, for example:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&   IVdf /* IV in decimal */
\&   UVxf /* UV is hexadecimal */
\&
\&   printf("i = %"IVdf"\en", i); /* The IVdf is a string constant. */
\&
\&   Uid_t_f /* Uid_t in decimal */
\&
\&   printf("who = %"Uid_t_f"\en", who);

Or you can try casting to a \*(L"wide enough\*(R" type:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   printf("i = %"IVdf"\en", (IV)something_very_small_and_signed);
.Ve
.Sp
Also remember that the \f(CW%p\fR format really does require a void pointer:
.Sp
.Vb 2

The gcc option \f(CW\*(C`\-Wformat\*(C'\fR scans for such problems.

How does the \s-1HAS_QUUX\s0 become defined where it needs to be?  Well, if
Foonix happens to be Unixy enough to be able to run the Configure

the corresponding configuration step will hopefully do the same.

In a pinch, if you cannot wait for Configure to be educated,

as any kind of guide to the use of the tools themselves.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0 1\fR: Running under memory debuggers such as Purify, valgrind, or
Third Degree greatly slows down the execution: seconds become minutes,

e.g. Purify, Third Degree, and valgrind.  Under valgrind it takes more
than six hours, even on a snappy computer. The said test must be
doing something that is quite unfriendly for memory debuggers.  If you
don't feel like waiting, that you can simply kill away the perl
process.
.PP
\&\fB\s-1NOTE\s0 2\fR: To minimize the number of memory leak false alarms (see

.SS "Rational Software's Purify"
.IX Subsection "Rational Software's Purify"
Purify is a commercial tool that is helpful in identifying
memory overruns, wild pointers, memory leaks and other such
badness.  Perl must be compiled in a specific way for
optimal testing with Purify.  Purify is available under
Windows \s-1NT\s0, Solaris, HP-UX, \s-1SGI\s0, and Siemens Unix.
.SS "Purify on Unix"
.IX Subsection "Purify on Unix"
On Unix, Purify creates a new Perl binary.  To get the most
benefit out of Purify, you should create the perl to Purify
using:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    sh Configure \-Accflags=\-DPURIFY \-Doptimize=\*(Aq\-g\*(Aq \e
\&     \-Uusemymalloc \-Dusemultiplicity
.Ve
.PP
where these arguments mean:
.IP "\-Accflags=\-DPURIFY" 4
.IX Item "-Accflags=-DPURIFY"
Disables Perl's arena memory allocation functions, as well as
forcing use of memory allocation functions derived from the
system malloc.
.IP "\-Doptimize='\-g'" 4
.IX Item "-Doptimize='-g'"
Adds debugging information so that you see the exact source
statements where the problem occurs.  Without this flag, all
you will see is the source filename of where the error occurred.
.IP "\-Uusemymalloc" 4
.IX Item "-Uusemymalloc"
Disable Perl's malloc so that Purify can more closely monitor
allocations and leaks.  Using Perl's malloc will make Purify
report most leaks in the \*(L"potential\*(R" leaks category.
.IP "\-Dusemultiplicity" 4
.IX Item "-Dusemultiplicity"
Enabling the multiplicity option allows perl to clean up
thoroughly when the interpreter shuts down, which reduces the
number of bogus leak reports from Purify.
.PP
Once you've compiled a perl suitable for Purify'ing, then you
can just:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    make pureperl
.Ve
.PP
which creates a binary named 'pureperl' that has been Purify'ed.
This binary is used in place of the standard 'perl' binary
when you want to debug Perl memory problems.
.PP
As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during the
standard Perl testset you would create and run the Purify'ed
perl as:
.PP
.Vb 3
\&    make pureperl
\&    cd t
\&    ../pureperl \-I../lib harness
.Ve
.PP
which would run Perl on test.pl and report any memory problems.
.PP
Purify outputs messages in \*(L"Viewer\*(R" windows by default.  If
you don't have a windowing environment or if you simply
want the Purify output to unobtrusively go to a log file
instead of to the interactive window, use these following
options to output to the log file \*(L"perl.log\*(R":
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    setenv PURIFYOPTIONS "\-chain\-length=25 \-windows=no \e
\&     \-log\-file=perl.log \-append\-logfile=yes"
.Ve

If you plan to use the \*(L"Viewer\*(R" windows, then you only need this option:
.PP

\&    setenv PURIFYOPTIONS "\-chain\-length=25"
.Ve
.PP
In Bourne-type shells:
.PP
.Vb 2
\&    PURIFYOPTIONS="..."

.IP "\s-1DEFINES\s0" 4
.IX Item "DEFINES"
You should add \-DPURIFY to the \s-1DEFINES\s0 line so the \s-1DEFINES\s0
line looks something like:
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&   DEFINES = \-DWIN32 \-D_CONSOLE \-DNO_STRICT $(CRYPT_FLAG) \-DPURIFY=1
.Ve
.Sp
to disable Perl's arena memory allocation functions, as
well as to force use of memory allocation functions derived
from the system malloc.
.IP "\s-1USE_MULTI\s0 = define" 4
.IX Item "USE_MULTI = define"
Enabling the multiplicity option allows perl to clean up
thoroughly when the interpreter shuts down, which reduces the
number of bogus leak reports from Purify.
.IP "#PERL_MALLOC = define" 4
.IX Item "#PERL_MALLOC = define"
Disable Perl's malloc so that Purify can more closely monitor
allocations and leaks.  Using Perl's malloc will make Purify
report most leaks in the \*(L"potential\*(R" leaks category.
.IP "\s-1CFG\s0 = Debug" 4
.IX Item "CFG = Debug"
Adds debugging information so that you see the exact source
statements where the problem occurs.  Without this flag, all
you will see is the source filename of where the error occurred.
.PP
As an example, to show any memory leaks produced during the
standard Perl testset you would create and run Purify as:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    cd win32
\&    make
\&    cd ../t
\&    purify ../perl \-I../lib harness
.Ve
.PP
which would instrument Perl in memory, run Perl on test.pl,
then finally report any memory problems.
.SS "valgrind"
.IX Subsection "valgrind"
The excellent valgrind tool can be used to find out both memory leaks
and illegal memory accesses.  As of version 3.3.0, Valgrind only
supports Linux on x86, x86\-64 and PowerPC.  The special \*(L"test.valgrind\*(R" 
target can be used to run the tests under valgrind.  Found errors 
and memory leaks are logged in files named \fItestfile.valgrind\fR.
.PP
Valgrind also provides a cachegrind tool, invoked on perl as:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    VG_OPTS=\-\-tool=cachegrind make test.valgrind
.Ve
.PP
As system libraries (most notably glibc) are also triggering errors,
valgrind allows to suppress such errors using suppression files. The
default suppression file that comes with valgrind already catches a lot
of them. Some additional suppressions are defined in \fIt/perl.supp\fR.

.SS "Compaq's/Digital's/HP's Third Degree"
.IX Subsection "Compaq's/Digital's/HP's Third Degree"
Third Degree is a tool for memory leak detection and memory access checks.
It is one of the many tools in the \s-1ATOM\s0 toolkit.  The toolkit is only
available on Tru64 (formerly known as Digital \s-1UNIX\s0 formerly known as
\&\s-1DEC\s0 \s-1OSF/1\s0).
.PP
When building Perl, you must first run Configure with \-Doptimize=\-g
and \-Uusemymalloc flags, after that you can use the make targets
\&\*(L"perl.third\*(R" and \*(L"test.third\*(R".  (What is required is that Perl must be
compiled using the \f(CW\*(C`\-g\*(C'\fR flag, you may need to re-Configure.)
.PP
The short story is that with \*(L"atom\*(R" you can instrument the Perl
executable to create a new executable called \fIperl.third\fR.  When the
instrumented executable is run, it creates a log of dubious memory
traffic in file called \fIperl.3log\fR.  See the manual pages of atom and
third for more information.  The most extensive Third Degree
documentation is available in the Compaq \*(L"Tru64 \s-1UNIX\s0 Programmer's
Guide\*(R", chapter \*(L"Debugging Programs with Third Degree\*(R".
.PP
The \*(L"test.third\*(R" leaves a lot of files named \fIfoo_bar.3log\fR in the t/
subdirectory.  There is a problem with these files: Third Degree is so
effective that it finds problems also in the system libraries.
Therefore you should used the Porting/thirdclean script to cleanup
the \fI*.3log\fR files.
.PP
There are also leaks that for given certain definition of a leak,
aren't.  See \*(L"\s-1PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL\s0\*(R" for more information.
.SS "\s-1PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL\s0"
.IX Subsection "PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL"
If you want to run any of the tests yourself manually using e.g.
valgrind, or the pureperl or perl.third executables, please note that
by default perl \fBdoes not\fR explicitly cleanup all the memory it has
allocated (such as global memory arenas) but instead lets the \fIexit()\fR
of the whole program \*(L"take care\*(R" of such allocations, also known as
\&\*(L"global destruction of objects\*(R".
.PP
There is a way to tell perl to do complete cleanup: set the
environment variable \s-1PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL\s0 to a non-zero value.
The t/TEST wrapper does set this to 2, and this is what you
need to do too, if you don't want to see the \*(L"global leaks\*(R":
For example, for \*(L"third-degreed\*(R" Perl:
.PP
.Vb 1
\&        env PERL_DESTRUCT_LEVEL=2 ./perl.third \-Ilib t/foo/bar.t
.Ve
.PP
(Note: the mod_perl apache module uses also this environment variable
for its own purposes and extended its semantics. Refer to the mod_perl
documentation for more information. Also, spawned threads do the
equivalent of setting this variable to the value 1.)
.PP
If, at the end of a run you get the message \fIN scalars leaked\fR, you can
recompile with \f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS\*(C'\fR, which will cause the addresses
of all those leaked SVs to be dumped along with details as to where each
\&\s-1SV\s0 was originally allocated. This information is also displayed by
Devel::Peek. Note that the extra details recorded with each \s-1SV\s0 increases
memory usage, so it shouldn't be used in production environments. It also
converts \f(CW\*(C`new_SV()\*(C'\fR from a macro into a real function, so you can use
your favourite debugger to discover where those pesky SVs were allocated.
.PP
If you see that you're leaking memory at runtime, but neither valgrind
nor \f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS\*(C'\fR will find anything, you're probably
leaking SVs that are still reachable and will be properly cleaned up
during destruction of the interpreter. In such cases, using the \f(CW\*(C`\-Dm\*(C'\fR
switch can point you to the source of the leak. If the executable was
built with \f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS\*(C'\fR, \f(CW\*(C`\-Dm\*(C'\fR will output \s-1SV\s0 allocations
in addition to memory allocations. Each \s-1SV\s0 allocation has a distinct
serial number that will be written on creation and destruction of the \s-1SV\s0. 
So if you're executing the leaking code in a loop, you need to look for
SVs that are created, but never destroyed between each cycle. If such an
\&\s-1SV\s0 is found, set a conditional breakpoint within \f(CW\*(C`new_SV()\*(C'\fR and make it
break only when \f(CW\*(C`PL_sv_serial\*(C'\fR is equal to the serial number of the
leaking \s-1SV\s0. Then you will catch the interpreter in exactly the state
where the leaking \s-1SV\s0 is allocated, which is sufficient in many cases to
find the source of the leak.
.PP
As \f(CW\*(C`\-Dm\*(C'\fR is using the PerlIO layer for output, it will by itself
allocate quite a bunch of SVs, which are hidden to avoid recursion.
You can bypass the PerlIO layer if you use the \s-1SV\s0 logging provided
by \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_MEM_LOG\*(C'\fR instead.
.SS "\s-1PERL_MEM_LOG\s0"
.IX Subsection "PERL_MEM_LOG"
If compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_MEM_LOG\*(C'\fR, both memory and \s-1SV\s0 allocations go
through logging functions, which is handy for breakpoint setting.
.PP
Unless \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_MEM_LOG_NOIMPL\*(C'\fR is also compiled, the logging
functions read \f(CW$ENV\fR{\s-1PERL_MEM_LOG\s0} to determine whether to log the
event, and if so how:
.PP
.Vb 4
\&    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /m/           Log all memory ops
\&    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /s/           Log all SV ops
\&    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /t/           include timestamp in Log
\&    $ENV{PERL_MEM_LOG} =~ /^(\ed+)/      write to FD given (default is 2)
.Ve
.PP
Memory logging is somewhat similar to \f(CW\*(C`\-Dm\*(C'\fR but is independent of
\&\f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUGGING\*(C'\fR, and at a higher level; all uses of \fINewx()\fR, \fIRenew()\fR,
and \fISafefree()\fR are logged with the caller's source code file and line
number (and C function name, if supported by the C compiler).  In
contrast, \f(CW\*(C`\-Dm\*(C'\fR is directly at the point of \f(CW\*(C`malloc()\*(C'\fR.  \s-1SV\s0 logging
is similar.
.PP
Since the logging doesn't use PerlIO, all \s-1SV\s0 allocations are logged
and no extra \s-1SV\s0 allocations are introduced by enabling the logging.
If compiled with \f(CW\*(C`\-DDEBUG_LEAKING_SCALARS\*(C'\fR, the serial number for
each \s-1SV\s0 allocation is also logged.
.SS "Profiling"
.IX Subsection "Profiling"
Depending on your platform there are various of profiling Perl.
.PP
There are two commonly used techniques of profiling executables:
\&\fIstatistical time-sampling\fR and \fIbasic-block counting\fR.
.PP
The first method takes periodically samples of the \s-1CPU\s0 program
counter, and since the program counter can be correlated with the code
generated for functions, we get a statistical view of in which
functions the program is spending its time.  The caveats are that very
small/fast functions have lower probability of showing up in the
profile, and that periodically interrupting the program (this is
usually done rather frequently, in the scale of milliseconds) imposes
an additional overhead that may skew the results.  The first problem
can be alleviated by running the code for longer (in general this is a
good idea for profiling), the second problem is usually kept in guard
by the profiling tools themselves.
.PP
The second method divides up the generated code into \fIbasic blocks\fR.
Basic blocks are sections of code that are entered only in the
beginning and exited only at the end.  For example, a conditional jump
starts a basic block.  Basic block profiling usually works by
\&\fIinstrumenting\fR the code by adding \fIenter basic block #nnnn\fR
book-keeping code to the generated code.  During the execution of the
code the basic block counters are then updated appropriately.  The
caveat is that the added extra code can skew the results: again, the
profiling tools usually try to factor their own effects out of the
results.
.SS "Gprof Profiling"

gprof is a profiling tool available in many Unix platforms,

be installed if you have gcc 3.0 or newer installed).  \fIgcov\fR is
run on source code files, like this
.PP
.Vb 1
\&    gcov sv.c
.Ve
.PP
which will cause \fIsv.c.gcov\fR to be created.  The \fI.gcov\fR files
contain the source code annotated with relative frequencies of
execution indicated by \*(L"#\*(R" markers.
.PP
Useful options of \fIgcov\fR include \f(CW\*(C`\-b\*(C'\fR which will summarise the
basic block, branch, and function call coverage, and \f(CW\*(C`\-c\*(C'\fR which
instead of relative frequencies will use the actual counts.  For
more information on the use of \fIgcov\fR and basic block profiling
with gcc, see the latest \s-1GNU\s0 \s-1CC\s0 manual, as of \s-1GCC\s0 3.0 see

.SS "Pixie Profiling"
.IX Subsection "Pixie Profiling"
Pixie is a profiling tool available on \s-1IRIX\s0 and Tru64 (aka Digital
\&\s-1UNIX\s0 aka \s-1DEC\s0 \s-1OSF/1\s0) platforms.  Pixie does its profiling using
\&\fIbasic-block counting\fR.
.PP
You can build a profiled version of perl called \fIperl.pixie\fR by
invoking the make target \*(L"perl.pixie\*(R" (what is required is that Perl
must be compiled using the \f(CW\*(C`\-g\*(C'\fR flag, you may need to re-Configure).
.PP
In Tru64 a file called \fIperl.Addrs\fR will also be silently created,
this file contains the addresses of the basic blocks.  Running the
profiled version of Perl will create a new file called \*(L"perl.Counts\*(R"
which contains the counts for the basic block for that particular
program execution.
.PP
To display the results you use the \fIprof\fR utility.  The exact
incantation depends on your operating system, \*(L"prof perl.Counts\*(R" in
\&\s-1IRIX\s0, and \*(L"prof \-pixie \-all \-L. perl\*(R" in Tru64.
.PP
In \s-1IRIX\s0 the following prof options are available:
.IP "\-h" 4
.IX Item "-h"
Reports the most heavily used lines in descending order of use.
Useful for finding the hotspot lines.
.IP "\-l" 4
.IX Item "-l"
Groups lines by procedure, with procedures sorted in descending order of use.
Within a procedure, lines are listed in source order.
Useful for finding the hotspots of procedures.
.PP
In Tru64 the following options are available:
.IP "\-p[rocedures]" 4
.IX Item "-p[rocedures]"
Procedures sorted in descending order by the number of cycles executed
in each procedure.  Useful for finding the hotspot procedures.
(This is the default option.)
.IP "\-h[eavy]" 4
.IX Item "-h[eavy]"
Lines sorted in descending order by the number of cycles executed in
each line.  Useful for finding the hotspot lines.
.IP "\-i[nvocations]" 4
.IX Item "-i[nvocations]"
The called procedures are sorted in descending order by number of calls
made to the procedures.  Useful for finding the most used procedures.
.IP "\-l[ines]" 4
.IX Item "-l[ines]"
Grouped by procedure, sorted by cycles executed per procedure.
Useful for finding the hotspots of procedures.
.IP "\-testcoverage" 4
.IX Item "-testcoverage"
The compiler emitted code for these lines, but the code was unexecuted.
.IP "\-z[ero]" 4
.IX Item "-z[ero]"
Unexecuted procedures.

Those debugging perl with the \s-1DDD\s0 frontend over gdb may find the
following useful:
.Sp
You can extend the data conversion shortcuts menu, so for example you
can display an \s-1SV\s0's \s-1IV\s0 value with one click, without doing any typing.
To do that simply edit ~/.ddd/init file and add after:
.Sp
.Vb 6
\&  ! Display shortcuts.
\&  Ddd*gdbDisplayShortcuts: \e
\&  /t ()   // Convert to Bin\en\e
\&  /d ()   // Convert to Dec\en\e
\&  /x ()   // Convert to Hex\en\e
\&  /o ()   // Convert to Oct(\en\e
.Ve
.Sp
the following two lines:
.Sp
.Vb 2
\&  ((XPV*) (())\->sv_any )\->xpv_pv  // 2pvx\en\e
\&  ((XPVIV*) (())\->sv_any )\->xiv_iv // 2ivx
.Ve
.Sp
so now you can do ivx and pvx lookups or you can plug there the
sv_peek \*(L"conversion\*(R":
.Sp
.Vb 1
\&  Perl_sv_peek(my_perl, (SV*)()) // sv_peek
.Ve
.Sp
(The my_perl is for threaded builds.)
Just remember that every line, but the last one, should end with \en\e
.Sp
Alternatively edit the init file interactively via:
3rd mouse button \-> New Display \-> Edit Menu
.Sp
Note: you can define up to 20 conversion shortcuts in the gdb
section.

If you see in a debugger a memory area mysteriously full of 0xABABABAB
or 0xEFEFEFEF, you may be seeing the effect of the \fIPoison()\fR macros,
see perlclib.
.IP "\(bu" 4
Under ithreads the optree is read only. If you want to enforce this, to check
for write accesses from buggy code, compile with \f(CW\*(C`\-DPL_OP_SLAB_ALLOC\*(C'\fR to
enable the \s-1OP\s0 slab allocator and \f(CW\*(C`\-DPERL_DEBUG_READONLY_OPS\*(C'\fR to enable code
that allocates op memory via \f(CW\*(C`mmap\*(C'\fR, and sets it read-only at run time.
Any write access to an op results in a \f(CW\*(C`SIGBUS\*(C'\fR and abort.
.Sp
This code is intended for development only, and may not be portable even to
all Unix variants. Also, it is an 80% solution, in that it isn't able to make
all ops read only. Specifically it
.RS 4
.IP "1." 4
Only sets read-only on all slabs of ops at \f(CW\*(C`CHECK\*(C'\fR time, hence ops allocated
later via \f(CW\*(C`require\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`eval\*(C'\fR will be re-write
.IP "2." 4
Turns an entire slab of ops read-write if the refcount of any op in the slab
needs to be decreased.
.IP "3." 4
Turns an entire slab of ops read-write if any op from the slab is freed.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
It's not possible to turn the slabs to read-only after an action requiring
read-write access, as either can happen during op tree building time, so
there may still be legitimate write access.
.Sp
However, as an 80% solution it is still effective, as currently it catches
a write access during the generation of \fIConfig.pm\fR, which means that we
can't yet build \fIperl\fR with this enabled.

.SH "CONCLUSION"
.IX Header "CONCLUSION"
We've had a brief look around the Perl source, how to maintain quality
of the source code, an overview of the stages \fIperl\fR goes through
when it's running your code, how to use debuggers to poke at the Perl
guts, and finally how to analyse the execution of Perl. We took a very
simple problem and demonstrated how to solve it fully \- with
documentation, regression tests, and finally a patch for submission to
p5p.  Finally, we talked about how to use external tools to debug and
test Perl.
.PP
I'd now suggest you read over those references again, and then, as soon
as possible, get your hands dirty. The best way to learn is by doing,
so:
.IP "\(bu" 3
Subscribe to perl5\-porters, follow the patches and try and understand
them; don't be afraid to ask if there's a portion you're not clear on \-
who knows, you may unearth a bug in the patch...
.IP "\(bu" 3
Keep up to date with the bleeding edge Perl distributions and get
familiar with the changes. Try and get an idea of what areas people are
working on and the changes they're making.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Do read the \s-1README\s0 associated with your operating system, e.g. \s-1README\s0.aix
on the \s-1IBM\s0 \s-1AIX\s0 \s-1OS\s0. Don't hesitate to supply patches to that \s-1README\s0 if
you find anything missing or changed over a new \s-1OS\s0 release.
.IP "\(bu" 3
Find an area of Perl that seems interesting to you, and see if you can
work out how it works. Scan through the source, and step over it in the
debugger. Play, poke, investigate, fiddle! You'll probably get to
understand not just your chosen area but a much wider range of \fIperl\fR's
activity as well, and probably sooner than you'd think.

If you can do these things, you've started on the long road to Perl porting.
Thanks for wanting to help make Perl better \- and happy hacking!
.SS "Metaphoric Quotations"
.IX Subsection "Metaphoric Quotations"
If you recognized the quote about the Road above, you're in luck.
.PP
Most software projects begin each file with a literal description of each
file's purpose.  Perl instead begins each with a literary allusion to that
file's purpose.
.PP
Like chapters in many books, all top-level Perl source files (along with a
few others here and there) begin with an epigramic inscription that alludes,
indirectly and metaphorically, to the material you're about to read.
.PP
Quotations are taken from writings of J.R.R Tolkien pertaining to his
Legendarium, almost always from \fIThe Lord of the Rings\fR.  Chapters and
page numbers are given using the following editions:
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIThe Hobbit\fR, by J.R.R. Tolkien.  The hardcover, 70th\-anniversary
edition of 2007 was used, published in the \s-1UK\s0 by Harper Collins Publishers
and in the \s-1US\s0 by the Houghton Mifflin Company.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIThe Lord of the Rings\fR, by J.R.R. Tolkien.  The hardcover,
50th\-anniversary edition of 2004 was used, published in the \s-1UK\s0 by Harper
Collins Publishers and in the \s-1US\s0 by the Houghton Mifflin Company.
.IP "\(bu" 4
\&\fIThe Lays of Beleriand\fR, by J.R.R. Tolkien and published posthumously by his
son and literary executor, C.J.R. Tolkien, being the 3rd of the 12 volumes
in Christopher's mammoth \fIHistory of Middle Earth\fR.  Page numbers derive
from the hardcover edition, first published in 1983 by George Allen &
Unwin; no page numbers changed for the special 3\-volume omnibus edition of
2002 or the various trade-paper editions, all again now by Harper Collins
or Houghton Mifflin.
.PP
Other \s-1JRRT\s0 books fair game for quotes would thus include \fIThe Adventures of
Tom Bombadil\fR, \fIThe Silmarillion\fR, \fIUnfinished Tales\fR, and \fIThe Tale of
the Children of Hurin\fR, all but the first posthumously assembled by \s-1CJRT\s0.
But \fIThe Lord of the Rings\fR itself is perfectly fine and probably best to
quote from, provided you can find a suitable quote there.
.PP
So if you were to supply a new, complete, top-level source file to add to
Perl, you should conform to this peculiar practice by yourself selecting an
appropriate quotation from Tolkien, retaining the original spelling and
punctuation and using the same format the rest of the quotes are in.
Indirect and oblique is just fine; remember, it's a metaphor, so being meta
is, after all, what it's for.
