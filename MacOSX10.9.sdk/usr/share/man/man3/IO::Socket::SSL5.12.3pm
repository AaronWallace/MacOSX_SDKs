.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.IX Header "DESCRIPTION"
This module is a true drop-in replacement for IO::Socket::INET that uses
\&\s-1SSL\s0 to encrypt data before it is transferred to a remote server or
client.	 IO::Socket::SSL supports all the extra features that one needs
to write a full-featured \s-1SSL\s0 client or server application: multiple \s-1SSL\s0 contexts,
cipher selection, certificate verification, and \s-1SSL\s0 version selection.	As an
extra bonus, it works perfectly with mod_perl.
.PP
If you have never used \s-1SSL\s0 before, you should read the appendix labelled 'Using \s-1SSL\s0'
before attempting to use this module.
.PP
If you have used this module before, read on, as versions 0.93 and above
have several changes from the previous IO::Socket::SSL versions (especially
see the note about return values).
.PP
If you are using non-blocking sockets read on, as version 0.98 added better
support for non-blocking.
.PP
If you are trying to use it with threads see the \s-1BUGS\s0 section.
.SH "METHODS"
.IX Header "METHODS"
IO::Socket::SSL inherits its methods from IO::Socket::INET, overriding them
as necessary.  If there is an \s-1SSL\s0 error, the method or operation will return an
empty list (false in all contexts).	 The methods that have changed from the
perspective of the user are re-documented here:
.IP "\fBnew(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "new(...)"
Creates a new IO::Socket::SSL object.  You may use all the friendly options
that came bundled with IO::Socket::INET, plus (optionally) the ones that follow:
.RS 4
.IP "SSL_version" 2
.IX Item "SSL_version"
Sets the version of the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol used to transmit data.	 The default is SSLv2/3,
which auto-negotiates between SSLv2 and SSLv3.	You may specify 'SSLv2', 'SSLv3', or
\&'TLSv1' (case-insensitive) if you do not want this behavior.
.IP "SSL_cipher_list" 2
.IX Item "SSL_cipher_list"
If this option is set the cipher list for the connection will be set to the
given value, e.g. something like '\s-1ALL:\s0!LOW:!EXP:!ADH'. Look into the OpenSSL
documentation (<http://www.openssl.org/docs/apps/ciphers.html#CIPHER_STRINGS>)
for more details.
If this option is not used the openssl builtin default is used which is suitable
for most cases.
.IP "SSL_use_cert" 2
.IX Item "SSL_use_cert"
If this is set, it forces IO::Socket::SSL to use a certificate and key, even if
you are setting up an \s-1SSL\s0 client.  If this is set to 0 (the default), then you will
only need a certificate and key if you are setting up a server.
.Sp
SSL_use_cert will implicitly be set if SSL_server is set.
For convinience it is also set if it was not given but a cert was given for use
(SSL_cert_file or similar).
.IP "SSL_server" 2
.IX Item "SSL_server"
Use this, if the socket should be used as a server.
If this is not explicitly set it is assumed, if Listen with given when creating
the socket.
.IP "SSL_key_file" 2
.IX Item "SSL_key_file"
If your \s-1RSA\s0 private key is not in default place (\fIcerts/server\-key.pem\fR for servers,
\&\fIcerts/client\-key.pem\fR for clients), then this is the option that you would use to
specify a different location.  Keys should be \s-1PEM\s0 formatted, and if they are
encrypted, you will be prompted to enter a password before the socket is formed
(unless you specified the SSL_passwd_cb option).
.IP "SSL_key" 2
.IX Item "SSL_key"
This is an EVP_PKEY* and can be used instead of SSL_key_file.
Useful if you don't have your key in a file but create it dynamically or get it from
a string (see openssl PEM_read_bio_PrivateKey etc for getting a EVP_PKEY* from
a string).
.IP "SSL_cert_file" 2
.IX Item "SSL_cert_file"
If your \s-1SSL\s0 certificate is not in the default place (\fIcerts/server\-cert.pem\fR for servers,
\&\fIcerts/client\-cert.pem\fR for clients), then you should use this option to specify the
location of your certificate.  Note that a key and certificate are only required for an
\&\s-1SSL\s0 server, so you do not need to bother with these trifling options should you be
setting up an unauthenticated client.
.IP "SSL_cert" 2
.IX Item "SSL_cert"
This is an X509* or an array of X509*.
The first X509* is the internal representation of the certificate while the following
ones are extra certificates. Useful if you create your certificate dynamically (like
in a \s-1SSL\s0 intercepting proxy) or get it from a string (see openssl PEM_read_bio_X509 etc
for getting a X509* from a string).
.IP "SSL_dh_file" 2
.IX Item "SSL_dh_file"
If you want Diffie-Hellman key exchange you need to supply a suitable file here
or use the SSL_dh parameter. See dhparam command in openssl for more information.
.IP "SSL_dh" 2
.IX Item "SSL_dh"
Like SSL_dh_file, but instead of giving a file you use a preloaded or generated DH*.
.IP "SSL_passwd_cb" 2
.IX Item "SSL_passwd_cb"
If your private key is encrypted, you might not want the default password prompt from
Net::SSLeay.  This option takes a reference to a subroutine that should return the
password required to decrypt your private key.
.IP "SSL_ca_file" 2
.IX Item "SSL_ca_file"
If you want to verify that the peer certificate has been signed by a reputable
certificate authority, then you should use this option to locate the file
containing the certificate(s) of the reputable certificate authorities if it is
not already in the file \fIcerts/my\-ca.pem\fR.
If you definitly want no SSL_ca_file used you should set it to undef.
.IP "SSL_ca_path" 2
.IX Item "SSL_ca_path"
If you are unusually friendly with the OpenSSL documentation, you might have set
yourself up a directory containing several trusted certificates as separate files
as well as an index of the certificates.  If you want to use that directory for
validation purposes, and that directory is not \fIca/\fR, then use this option to
point IO::Socket::SSL to the right place to look.
If you definitly want no SSL_ca_path used you should set it to undef.
.IP "SSL_verify_mode" 2
.IX Item "SSL_verify_mode"
This option sets the verification mode for the peer certificate.  The default
(0x00) does no authentication.	You may combine 0x01 (verify peer), 0x02 (fail
verification if no peer certificate exists; ignored for clients), and 0x04
(verify client once) to change the default.
.Sp
See OpenSSL man page for SSL_CTX_set_verify for more information.
.IP "SSL_verify_callback" 2
.IX Item "SSL_verify_callback"
If you want to verify certificates yourself, you can pass a sub reference along
with this parameter to do so.  When the callback is called, it will be passed:
.RS 2
.IP "1. a true/false value that indicates what OpenSSL thinks of the certificate," 4
.IX Item "1. a true/false value that indicates what OpenSSL thinks of the certificate,"
.PD 0
.IP "2. a C\-style memory address of the certificate store," 4
.IX Item "2. a C-style memory address of the certificate store,"
.IP "3. a string containing the certificate's issuer attributes and owner attributes, and" 4
.IX Item "3. a string containing the certificate's issuer attributes and owner attributes, and"
.IP "4. a string containing any errors encountered (0 if no errors)." 4
.IX Item "4. a string containing any errors encountered (0 if no errors)."
.IP "5. a C\-style memory address of the peer's own certificate (convertible to \s-1PEM\s0 form with \fINet::SSLeay::PEM_get_string_X509()\fR)." 4
.IX Item "5. a C-style memory address of the peer's own certificate (convertible to PEM form with Net::SSLeay::PEM_get_string_X509())."
.RE
.RS 2
.PD
.Sp
The function should return 1 or 0, depending on whether it thinks the certificate
is valid or invalid.  The default is to let OpenSSL do all of the busy work.
.Sp
The callback will be called for each element in the certificate chain.
.Sp
See the OpenSSL documentation for SSL_CTX_set_verify for more information.
.RE
.IP "SSL_verifycn_scheme" 2
.IX Item "SSL_verifycn_scheme"
Set the scheme used to automatically verify the hostname of the peer.
See the information about the verification schemes in \fBverify_hostname\fR.
The default is undef, e.g. to not automatically verify the hostname.
.IP "SSL_verifycn_name" 2
.IX Item "SSL_verifycn_name"
Set the name which is used in verification of hostname. If SSL_verifycn_scheme
is set and no SSL_verifycn_name is given it will try to use the PeerHost and
PeerAddr settings and fail if no name caan be determined.
.Sp
Using PeerHost or PeerAddr works only if you create the connection directly
with \f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL\->new\*(C'\fR, if an IO::Socket::INET object is upgraded
with \fBstart_SSL\fR the name has to be given in \fBSSL_verifycn_name\fR.
.IP "SSL_check_crl" 2
.IX Item "SSL_check_crl"
If you want to verify that the peer certificate has not been revoked
by the signing authority, set this value to true. OpenSSL will search
for the \s-1CRL\s0 in your SSL_ca_path, or use the file specified by
SSL_crl_file.  See the Net::SSLeay documentation for more details.
Note that this functionality appears to be broken with OpenSSL <
v0.9.7b, so its use with lower versions will result in an error.
.IP "SSL_crl_file" 2
.IX Item "SSL_crl_file"
If you want to specify the \s-1CRL\s0 file to be used, set this value to the
pathname to be used.  This must be used in addition to setting
SSL_check_crl.
.IP "SSL_reuse_ctx" 2
.IX Item "SSL_reuse_ctx"
If you have already set the above options (SSL_version through SSL_check_crl;
this does not include SSL_cipher_list yet) for a previous instance of
IO::Socket::SSL, then you can reuse the \s-1SSL\s0 context of that instance by passing
it as the value for the SSL_reuse_ctx parameter.  You may also create a
new instance of the IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_Context class, using any context options
that you desire without specifying connection options, and pass that here instead.
.Sp
If you use this option, all other context-related options that you pass
in the same call to \fInew()\fR will be ignored unless the context supplied was invalid.
Note that, contrary to versions of IO::Socket::SSL below v0.90, a global \s-1SSL\s0 context
will not be implicitly used unless you use the \fIset_default_context()\fR function.
.IP "SSL_create_ctx_callback" 2
.IX Item "SSL_create_ctx_callback"
With this callback you can make individual settings to the context after it
got created and the default setup was done.
The callback will be called with the \s-1CTX\s0 object from Net::SSLeay as the single
argument.
.Sp
Example for limiting the server session cache size:
.Sp
.Vb 4
\&  SSL_create_ctx_callback => sub { 
\&      my $ctx = shift;
\&          Net::SSLeay::CTX_sess_set_cache_size($ctx,128);
\&  }
.Ve
.IP "SSL_session_cache_size" 2
.IX Item "SSL_session_cache_size"
If you make repeated connections to the same host/port and the \s-1SSL\s0 renegotiation time
is an issue, you can turn on client-side session caching with this option by specifying a
positive cache size.  For successive connections, pass the SSL_reuse_ctx option to
the \fInew()\fR calls (or use \fIset_default_context()\fR) to make use of the cached sessions.
The session cache size refers to the number of unique host/port pairs that can be
stored at one time; the oldest sessions in the cache will be removed if new ones are
added.
.IP "SSL_session_cache" 2
.IX Item "SSL_session_cache"
Specifies session cache object which should be used instead of creating a new.
Overrules SSL_session_cache_size.
This option is useful if you want to reuse the cache, but not the rest of
the context.
.Sp
A session cache object can be created using
\&\f(CW\*(C`IO::Socket::SSL::Session_Cache\->new( cachesize )\*(C'\fR.
.Sp
Use \fIset_default_session_cache()\fR to set a global cache object.
.IP "SSL_error_trap" 2
.IX Item "SSL_error_trap"
When using the \fIaccept()\fR or \fIconnect()\fR methods, it may be the case that the
actual socket connection works but the \s-1SSL\s0 negotiation fails, as in the case of
an \s-1HTTP\s0 client connecting to an \s-1HTTPS\s0 server.  Passing a subroutine ref attached
to this parameter allows you to gain control of the orphaned socket instead of having it
be closed forcibly.	 The subroutine, if called, will be passed two parameters:
a reference to the socket on which the \s-1SSL\s0 negotiation failed and and the full
text of the error message.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBclose(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "close(...)"
There are a number of nasty traps that lie in wait if you are not careful about using
\&\fIclose()\fR.  The first of these will bite you if you have been using \fIshutdown()\fR on your
sockets.  Since the \s-1SSL\s0 protocol mandates that a \s-1SSL\s0 \*(L"close notify\*(R" message be
sent before the socket is closed, a \fIshutdown()\fR that closes the socket's write channel
will cause the \fIclose()\fR call to hang.  For a similar reason, if you try to close a
copy of a socket (as in a forking server) you will affect the original socket as well.
To get around these problems, call close with an object-oriented syntax
(e.g. \f(CW$socket\fR\->close(SSL_no_shutdown => 1))
and one or more of the following parameters:
.RS 4
.IP "SSL_no_shutdown" 2
.IX Item "SSL_no_shutdown"
If set to a true value, this option will make \fIclose()\fR not use the \fISSL_shutdown()\fR call
on the socket in question so that the close operation can complete without problems
if you have used \fIshutdown()\fR or are working on a copy of a socket.
.IP "SSL_fast_shutdown" 2
.IX Item "SSL_fast_shutdown"
If set to true only a unidirectional shutdown will be done, e.g. only the
close_notify (see \fISSL_shutdown\fR\|(3)) will be called. Otherwise a bidrectional
shutdown will be done. If used within \fIclose()\fR it defaults to true, if used
within \fIstop_SSL()\fR it defaults to false.
.IP "SSL_ctx_free" 2
.IX Item "SSL_ctx_free"
If you want to make sure that the \s-1SSL\s0 context of the socket is destroyed when
you close it, set this option to a true value.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBpeek(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "peek(...)"
This function has exactly the same syntax as \fIsysread()\fR, and performs nearly the same
task (reading data from the socket) but will not advance the read position so
that successive calls to \fIpeek()\fR with the same arguments will return the same results.
This function requires OpenSSL 0.9.6a or later to work.
.IP "\fB\f(BIpending()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "pending()"
This function will let you know how many bytes of data are immediately ready for reading
from the socket.  This is especially handy if you are doing reads on a blocking socket
or just want to know if new data has been sent over the socket.
.IP "\fB\f(BIget_cipher()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "get_cipher()"
Returns the string form of the cipher that the IO::Socket::SSL object is using.
.IP "\fB\f(BIdump_peer_certificate()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "dump_peer_certificate()"
Returns a parsable string with select fields from the peer \s-1SSL\s0 certificate.	 This
method directly returns the result of the \fIdump_peer_certificate()\fR method of Net::SSLeay.
.IP "\fBpeer_certificate($field)\fR" 4
.IX Item "peer_certificate($field)"
If a peer certificate exists, this function can retrieve values from it.
If no field is given the internal representation of certificate from Net::SSLeay is
returned.
The following fields can be queried:
.RS 4
.IP "authority (alias issuer)" 8
.IX Item "authority (alias issuer)"
The certificate authority which signed the certificate.
.IP "owner (alias subject)" 8
.IX Item "owner (alias subject)"
The owner of the certificate.
.IP "commonName (alias cn) \- only for Net::SSLeay version >=1.30" 8
.IX Item "commonName (alias cn) - only for Net::SSLeay version >=1.30"
The common name, usually the server name for \s-1SSL\s0 certificates.
.IP "subjectAltNames \- only for Net::SSLeay version >=1.33" 8
.IX Item "subjectAltNames - only for Net::SSLeay version >=1.33"
Alternative names for the subject, usually different names for the same
server, like example.org, example.com, *.example.com.
.Sp
It returns a list of (typ,value) with typ \s-1GEN_DNS\s0, \s-1GEN_IPADD\s0 etc (these
constants are exported from IO::Socket::SSL).
See Net::SSLeay::X509_get_subjectAltNames.
.RE
.RS 4
.RE
.IP "\fBverify_hostname($hostname,$scheme)\fR" 4
.IX Item "verify_hostname($hostname,$scheme)"
This verifies the given hostname against the peer certificate using the
given scheme. Hostname is usually what you specify within the PeerAddr.
.Sp
Verification of hostname against a certificate is different between various
applications and RFCs. Some scheme allow wildcards for hostnames, some only
in subjectAltNames, and even their different wildcard schemes are possible.
.Sp
To ease the verification the following schemes are predefined:
.RS 4
.IP "ldap (rfc4513), pop3,imap,acap (rfc2995), nntp (rfc4642)" 8
.IX Item "ldap (rfc4513), pop3,imap,acap (rfc2995), nntp (rfc4642)"
Simple wildcards in subjectAltNames are possible, e.g. *.example.org matches
www.example.org but not lala.www.example.org. If nothing from subjectAltNames
match it checks against the common name, but there are no wildcards allowed.
.IP "http (rfc2818), alias is www" 8
.IX Item "http (rfc2818), alias is www"
Extended wildcards in subjectAltNames and common name are possible, e.g. 
*.example.org or even www*.example.org. The common
name will be only checked if no names are given in subjectAltNames.
.IP "smtp (rfc3207)" 8
.IX Item "smtp (rfc3207)"
This \s-1RFC\s0 doesn't say much useful about the verification so it just assumes
that subjectAltNames are possible, but no wildcards are possible anywhere.
.RE
.RS 4
.Sp
The scheme can be given either by specifying the name for one of the above predefined
schemes, by using a callback (see below) or by using a hash which can have the
following keys and values:
.IP "check_cn:  0|'always'|'when_only'" 8
.IX Item "check_cn:  0|'always'|'when_only'"
Determines if the common name gets checked. If 'always' it will always be checked
(like in ldap), if 'when_only' it will only be checked if no names are given in
subjectAltNames (like in http), for any other values the common name will not be checked.
.IP "wildcards_in_alt: 0|'leftmost'|'anywhere'" 8
.IX Item "wildcards_in_alt: 0|'leftmost'|'anywhere'"
Determines if and where wildcards in subjectAltNames are possible. If 'leftmost'
only cases like *.example.org will be possible (like in ldap), for 'anywhere'
www*.example.org is possible too (like http), dangerous things like but www.*.org
or even '*' will not be allowed.
.IP "wildcards_in_cn: 0|'leftmost'|'anywhere'" 8

If you give a subroutine for verification it will be called with the arguments
($hostname,$commonName,@subjectAltNames), where hostname is the name given for
verification, commonName is the result from peer_certificate('cn') and
subjectAltNames is the result from peer_certificate('subjectAltNames').

.IP "\fB\f(BIerrstr()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "errstr()"
Returns the last error (in string form) that occurred.	If you do not have a real
object to perform this method on, call \fIIO::Socket::SSL::errstr()\fR instead.
.Sp
For read and write errors on non-blocking sockets, this method may include the string
\&\f(CW\*(C`SSL wants a read first!\*(C'\fR or \f(CW\*(C`SSL wants a write first!\*(C'\fR meaning that the other side
is expecting to read from or write to the socket and wants to be satisfied before you
get to do anything. But with version 0.98 you are better comparing the global exported
variable \f(CW$SSL_ERROR\fR against the exported symbols \s-1SSL_WANT_READ\s0 and \s-1SSL_WANT_WRITE\s0.
.IP "\fB\f(BIopened()\fB\fR" 4
.IX Item "opened()"
This returns false if the socket could not be opened, 1 if the socket could be opened
and the \s-1SSL\s0 handshake was successful done and \-1 if the underlying IO::Handle is open,
but the \s-1SSL\s0 handshake failed.
.IP "\fBIO::Socket::SSL\->start_SSL($socket, ... )\fR" 4
.IX Item "IO::Socket::SSL->start_SSL($socket, ... )"
This will convert a glob reference or a socket that you provide to an IO::Socket::SSL
object.	 You may also pass parameters to specify context or connection options as with
a call to \fInew()\fR.  If you are using this function on an \fIaccept()\fRed socket, you must
set the parameter \*(L"SSL_server\*(R" to 1, i.e. IO::Socket::SSL\->start_SSL($socket, SSL_server => 1).
If you have a class that inherits from IO::Socket::SSL and you want the \f(CW$socket\fR to be blessed
into your own class instead, use MyClass\->start_SSL($socket) to achieve the desired effect.
.Sp
Note that if \fIstart_SSL()\fR fails in \s-1SSL\s0 negotiation, \f(CW$socket\fR will remain blessed in its
original class.	 For non-blocking sockets you better just upgrade the socket to
IO::Socket::SSL and call accept_SSL or connect_SSL and the upgraded object. To
just upgrade the socket set \fBSSL_startHandshake\fR explicitly to 0. If you call start_SSL
w/o this parameter it will revert to blocking behavior for accept_SSL and connect_SSL.
.Sp
If given the parameter \*(L"Timeout\*(R" it will stop if after the timeout no \s-1SSL\s0 connection
was established. This parameter is only used for blocking sockets, if it is not given the
default Timeout from the underlying IO::Socket will be used.
.IP "\fBstop_SSL(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "stop_SSL(...)"
This is the opposite of \fIstart_SSL()\fR, e.g. it will shutdown the \s-1SSL\s0 connection
and return to the class before \fIstart_SSL()\fR. It gets the same arguments as \fIclose()\fR,
in fact \fIclose()\fR calls \fIstop_SSL()\fR (but without downgrading the class).
.Sp
Will return true if it suceeded and undef if failed. This might be the case for
non-blocking sockets. In this case $! is set to \s-1EAGAIN\s0 and the ssl error to
\&\s-1SSL_WANT_READ\s0 or \s-1SSL_WANT_WRITE\s0. In this case the call should be retried again with
the same arguments once the socket is ready is until it succeeds.
.IP "\fBIO::Socket::SSL\->new_from_fd($fd, ...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "IO::Socket::SSL->new_from_fd($fd, ...)"
This will convert a socket identified via a file descriptor into an \s-1SSL\s0 socket.
Note that the argument list does not include a \*(L"\s-1MODE\s0\*(R" argument; if you supply one,
it will be thoughtfully ignored (for compatibility with IO::Socket::INET).	Instead,
a mode of '+<' is assumed, and the file descriptor passed must be able to handle such
I/O because the initial \s-1SSL\s0 handshake requires bidirectional communication.
.IP "\fBIO::Socket::SSL::set_default_context(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "IO::Socket::SSL::set_default_context(...)"
You may use this to make IO::Socket::SSL automatically re-use a given context (unless
specifically overridden in a call to \fInew()\fR).  It accepts one argument, which should
be either an IO::Socket::SSL object or an IO::Socket::SSL::SSL_Context object.	See
the SSL_reuse_ctx option of \fInew()\fR for more details.	 Note that this sets the default
context globally, so use with caution (esp. in mod_perl scripts).
.IP "\fBIO::Socket::SSL::set_default_session_cache(...)\fR" 4
.IX Item "IO::Socket::SSL::set_default_session_cache(...)"
You may use this to make IO::Socket::SSL automatically re-use a given session cache
(unless specifically overridden in a call to \fInew()\fR).  It accepts one argument, which should
be an IO::Socket::SSL::Session_Cache object or similar (e.g something which implements
get_session and add_session like IO::Socket::SSL::Session_Cache does).
See the SSL_session_cache option of \fInew()\fR for more details.	 Note that this sets the default
cache globally, so use with caution.
.IP "\fBIO::Socket::SSL::set_ctx_defaults(%args)\fR" 4
.IX Item "IO::Socket::SSL::set_ctx_defaults(%args)"
With this function one can set defaults for all SSL_* parameter used for creation of
the context, like the SSL_verify* parameter.

Note that \fIsend()\fR and \fIrecv()\fR cannot be reliably trapped by a tied filehandle (such as
that used by IO::Socket::SSL) and so may send unencrypted data over the socket.	 Object-oriented
calls to these functions will fail, telling you to use the print/printf/syswrite
and read/sysread families instead.
.SH "IPv6"
.IX Header "IPv6"
Support for IPv6 with IO::Socket::SSL is expected to work and basic testing is done.
If IO::Socket::INET6 is available it will automatically use it instead of
IO::Socket::INET4.
.PP
Please be aware of the associated problems: If you give a name as a host and the
host resolves to both IPv6 and IPv4 it will try IPv6 first and if there is no IPv6
connectivity it will fail.
.PP
To avoid these problems you can either force IPv4 by specifying and \s-1AF_INET\s0 as the
Domain (this is per socket) or load IO::Socket::SSL with the option 'inet4'
(This is a global setting, e.g. affects all IO::Socket::SSL objects in the program).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.IX Header "RETURN VALUES"
A few changes have gone into IO::Socket::SSL v0.93 and later with respect to
return values.	The behavior on success remains unchanged, but for \fIall\fR functions,
the return value on error is now an empty list.	 Therefore, the return value will be
false in all contexts, but those who have been using the return values as arguments
to subroutines (like \f(CW\*(C`mysub(IO::Socket::SSL(...)\-\*(C'\fRnew, ...)>) may run into problems.
The moral of the story: \fIalways\fR check the return values of these functions before
using them in any way that you consider meaningful.
.SH "DEBUGGING"
.IX Header "DEBUGGING"
If you are having problems using IO::Socket::SSL despite the fact that can recite backwards
the section of this documentation labelled 'Using \s-1SSL\s0', you should try enabling debugging.	To
specify the debug level, pass 'debug#' (where # is a number from 0 to 3) to IO::Socket::SSL
when calling it.
The debug level will also be propagated to Net::SSLeay::trace, see also Net::SSLeay:
.IP "use IO::Socket::SSL qw(debug0);" 4

.SH "BUGS"
.IX Header "BUGS"
IO::Socket::SSL is not threadsafe.
This is because IO::Socket::SSL is based on Net::SSLeay which
uses a global object to access some of the \s-1API\s0 of openssl
and is therefore not threadsafe.
It might probably work if you don't use SSL_verify_callback and
SSL_password_cb.
.PP
IO::Socket::SSL does not work together with Storable::fd_retrieve/fd_store.
See \s-1BUGS\s0 file for more information and how to work around the problem.
.PP
Non-blocking and timeouts (which are based on non-blocking) are not
supported on Win32, because the underlying IO::Socket::INET does not support
non-blocking on this platform.
.PP
If you have a server and it looks like you have a memory leak you might 
check the size of your session cache. Default for Net::SSLeay seems to be 
20480, see the example for SSL_create_ctx_callback for how to limit it.
.SH "LIMITATIONS"
.IX Header "LIMITATIONS"
IO::Socket::SSL uses Net::SSLeay as the shiny interface to OpenSSL, which is
the shiny interface to the ugliness of \s-1SSL\s0.	 As a result, you will need both Net::SSLeay
and OpenSSL on your computer before using this module.
.PP
If you have Scalar::Util (standard with Perl 5.8.0 and above) or WeakRef, IO::Socket::SSL
sockets will auto-close when they go out of scope, just like IO::Socket::INET sockets.	If
you do not have one of these modules, then IO::Socket::SSL sockets will stay open until the
program ends or you explicitly close them.	This is due to the fact that a circular reference
is required to make IO::Socket::SSL sockets act simultaneously like objects and glob references.

If you are unfamiliar with the way OpenSSL works, good references may be found in

http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL\-Certificates\-HOWTO/ <http://www.tldp.org/HOWTO/SSL-Certificates-HOWTO/>.  Read on for a quick overview.
.SS "The Long of It (Detail)"
.IX Subsection "The Long of It (Detail)"
The usual reason for using \s-1SSL\s0 is to keep your data safe.  This means that not only
do you have to encrypt the data while it is being transported over a network, but
you also have to make sure that the right person gets the data.	 To accomplish this
with \s-1SSL\s0, you have to use certificates.	 A certificate closely resembles a
Government-issued \s-1ID\s0 (at least in places where you can trust them).	 The \s-1ID\s0 contains some sort of
identifying information such as a name and address, and is usually stamped with a seal
of Government Approval.	 Theoretically, this means that you may trust the information on
the card and do business with the owner of the card.  The same ideas apply to \s-1SSL\s0 certificates,
which have some identifying information and are \*(L"stamped\*(R" [most people refer to this as
\&\fIsigning\fR instead] by someone (a Certificate Authority) who you trust will adequately
verify the identifying information.	 In this case, because of some clever number theory,
it is extremely difficult to falsify the stamping process.	Another useful consequence
of number theory is that the certificate is linked to the encryption process, so you may
encrypt data (using information on the certificate) that only the certificate owner can
decrypt.
.PP
What does this mean for you?  It means that at least one person in the party has to
have an \s-1ID\s0 to get drinks :\-).  Seriously, it means that one of the people communicating
has to have a certificate to ensure that your data is safe.	 For client/server
interactions, the server must \fBalways\fR have a certificate.	 If the server wants to
verify that the client is safe, then the client must also have a personal certificate.
To verify that a certificate is safe, one compares the stamped \*(L"seal\*(R" [commonly called
an \fIencrypted digest/hash/signature\fR] on the certificate with the official \*(L"seal\*(R" of
the Certificate Authority to make sure that they are the same.	To do this, you will
need the [unfortunately named] certificate of the Certificate Authority.  With all these
in hand, you can set up a \s-1SSL\s0 connection and be reasonably confident that no-one is
reading your data.
.SS "The Short of It (Summary)"
.IX Subsection "The Short of It (Summary)"
For servers, you will need to generate a cryptographic private key and a certificate
request.  You will need to send the certificate request to a Certificate Authority to
get a real certificate back, after which you can start serving people.	For clients,
you will not need anything unless the server wants validation, in which case you will
also need a private key and a real certificate.	 For more information about how to
get these, see <http://www.modssl.org/docs/2.8/ssl_faq.html#ToC24>.
