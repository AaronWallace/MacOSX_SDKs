.Sh DESCRIPTION          \" Section Header - required - don't modify
.Nm
is a utility for administering services.  In general, it gives you access to the same functionality
present in the Xsan Admin application. It must be run by root.
.Sh OPTIONS
The following options are available:
.Bl -tag -width ".Cm --version" -compact
.It Fl d
.It Cm --debug
Print command to the terminal.
.Pp
.It Fl h
.It Cm --help
Print usage summary and exit.
.Pp
.It Fl v
.It Cm --version
Print build version and exit.
.Pp
.It Fl x
.It Cm --xml
Generate output as XML instead of key-value pairs.
.El
.Sh USAGE
Except when requesting information with
.Nm
.Fl h
or
.Nm
.Fl v ,
you must specify a
.Ar command
to select a specific function to perform. Each command accepts its
own arguments.
.Sh COMMAND SUMMARY
Here are brief descriptions of all the
.Nm
commands:
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It Cm list
Returns a list of all available services.
.It Cm start Ar service
Starts the specified service.
.It Cm stop Ar service
Stops the specified service.
.It Cm status Ar service
Returns whether or not the service is running.
.It Cm fullstatus Ar service
Returns service specific status information. This generally corresponds
to the information shown in the status panel of the Xsan Admin application.
.It Cm settings Ar command_args
This command is used to read and write settings information. It can take
arguments from the command line or standard input.
.Cm set
can be used instead of
.Cm settings .
.It Cm command Ar command_args
Allows service specific commands to be performed.
.Cm com
can be used instead of
.Cm command .
.El
.Sh COMMAND ARGUMENTS
Input and output is done using key value pairs.  Keys are specified using colon separated strings,
with the first element being the service name (eg. afp:idleDisconnectFlag:adminUsers).  Values have types.
If the value is in quotes, it is always considered to be a string.  Otherwise numbers (5, 10, 8.2) and
booleans (yes or no) are converted to the appropriate type.  Assignments are always of the form
\fIkey\fP = \fIvalue\fP (eg. afp:guestAccess = yes).
.Pp
If only one key needs to be specified (or set), it can be placed on the command line after the command
(eg. xsanadmin set afp:guestAccess = yes).  However, in some case when doing \fBsettings\fP or
\fBcommand\fP, multiple key/value pairs need to be specified.  In this case, leaving them out of the
argument list (eg. 
.Nm
\fBsettings\fP) will cause the program to read either keys or key/value pairs
from the standard input until an end of file (EOF) is reached.  The keys or key/value pairs must be one
per line.
.Pp
For \fBsettings\fP, if no values are specified for the keys, the key value will be read and printed.
Otherwise if there is a key/value pair of the form \fIkey\fP = \fIvalue\fP, the value will be set
and then echoed back to the output.  In general, the best approach is to fetch the settings for an 
individual service (eg.
.Nm
\fBsettings afp > dumpfile\fP and then using the output as a template for changing settings.  Any output
when fetching settings can be fed in to set values.
.Pp
When setting array values, special notation is needed.  There are two types of arrays.  Some arrays have
special id keys that allow you to access individual array elements.  These are accessed using the
special key _array_id followed by the value of the id tag (eg. web:Modules:_array_id:dav_module).
To add a new element to such an array, you need to have a special line with a "create" value. For example,
to add a new web site to the web configuration, you would need:
.Bd -literal
	web:Sites:_array_id:MySite = create
	web:Sites:_array_id:MySite:enabled = yes
            etc.
.Ed
.Pp
To delete an element of an array, use the "delete" value (eg. web:Sites:_array_id:MySite = delete).
.Pp
For \fBcommand\fP, you always need to specify the command type (eg. afp:command = getConnectedUsers).  Commands
are highly specific to the individual services.  See the examples sections for some possible commands.
.Pp
.Sh EXAMPLES
.Bl -tag -width Ds
.It xsanadmin settings all > outfile
Stores settings from all services into a file.
.It xsanadmin settings < outfile
Will take any settings file and set the values.
.It xsanadmin command < commandFile
Will execute a command specified in commandFile. Some examples of commands are:
.Bd -literal
    info:command = getHardwareInfo
    info:variant = withQuotaUsage
