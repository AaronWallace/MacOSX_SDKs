.Sh NAME
.Nm ioclasscount
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.Nm
.Op classname
.Op ...
.Sh DESCRIPTION
.Nm
displays the instance counts of OSObject-based C++ classes in the kernel,
incremented by the number of
.Em direct
subclasses that have an instance count of at least 1.
For example, if IONetworkController is not directly instantiated,
but its direct subclass IOEthernetController has any instances,
then IONetworkController's instance count will be at least 1;
if another direct subclass such as IOFWController has any instances,
then IONetworkController's instance count will be at least 2; and so on.
(This modification of instance counts prevents unloading of
kexts defining superclasses that have no instances,
but whose subclasses in other kexts have instances.)
.Pp
If classes are specified,
instance counts are printed as a comma-separated list
in the order specified.
If no classes are specified,
instance counts for all classes are printed,
one per line of output and sorted by name.
.Pp
This information is useful for tracking leaks.
Instance counts can also found in the root of the IORegistry
in the
.Dq IOKitDiagnostics
property.
.Sh EXAMPLES
Display instance counts for IOPCIDevice and AppleTestPCI:
.Bl -tag -width findx
.It Li "/usr/sbin/ioclasscount IOPCIDevice AppleTestPCI"
IOPCIDevice = 2, AppleTestPCI = 1
