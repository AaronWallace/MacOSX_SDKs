    NSPathControl

    The NSPathControl is closely tied to the NSPathCell and NSPathComponentCell. See those classes for more detailed information.
 
    To accept drag and drop, the NSPathControl automatically calls registerForDraggedTypes: with NSFilenamesPboardType and NSURLPboardType.
 
    When the URL value in the NSPathControl changes from an automatic drag and drop operation, or from the user selecting a new path via the open panel, the action is sent, but the clickedPathComponentCell will be nil.
