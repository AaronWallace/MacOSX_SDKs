 @discussion The IMService API provides a way to integrate a variety of data about a user's Messages connections into your
 application. It provides information on which services the user is connected to (AIM, Jabber, or Bonjour), their online
 screen names, their lists of acquaintances, their current status on a given service (away, idle, available), idle
 times, and other presence-specific details. The API also provides notifications to update your applications when
 a user's status, information, status images, or service connections have changed.
 
 A variety of status notifications related to the user's status and preferences are posted by the 
 IMService custom notification center. See "Notifications" for more information.

 @abstract An IMService object represents a service available to a user through Messages, such as AIM, Jabber, and Bonjour.
 @discussion Each IMService object represents one service available through Messages. Class methods such as <tt>allServices</tt>

 allowing you to access the individual user's global status, the user's list of acquaintances, and other information
 which can be integrated into your application.
