	@discussion		There are some suggested error checks developers should provide before using this object.  When 
					connecting out to a remote device developers need to check that the device has the Headset service in 
					its SDP records. Use the provided class method in this object.

					To attach to a device that has connected into the machine, developers need to check for the existence of 
					the service (using the provided class method in this object), that the device is attaching to the RFCOMM 
					channel associated with the Headset Gateway SDP record published on the machine, and that the device 
					that is connecting is configured as a headset with the machine.  Developers will need to search the local
					SDP records to find the Gateway record for the machine, the provided APIs are only for the target device.
