Example: there are five items on the pasteboard, two contain TIFF data, two contain RTF data, one contains a private data type.

Calling with just the NSAttributedString class, will return an array containing two attributed strings.  Calling with both classes will return two image objects and two attributed strings.

In this example, an array containing the NSImage, NSAttributedString, and NSSPasteboardItem classes will return an array with two images, two attributed strings, and one pasteboard item containing the private data type.

The translated type is added to the types array ahead of PICT so that the deprecated PICT format is not the preferred format.  In addition, when an application provides image data to NSPasteboard, the Carbon Pasteboard Manager will automatically make a PICT translation available to 32-bit Carbon applications.
