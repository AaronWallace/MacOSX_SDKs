 @discussion
   Instances of AVVideoCompositionCoreAnimationTool are for use with offline rendering (AVAssetExportSession and AVAssetReader), not with AVPlayer.
   To synchronize real-time playback with other CoreAnimation layers, use AVSynchronizedLayer.

   Any animations will be interpreted on the video's timeline, not real-time, so 
		(a) set animation beginTimes to small positive value such as AVCoreAnimationBeginTimeAtZero rather than 0, 
		    because CoreAnimation will replace a value of 0 with CACurrentMediaTime(); 
		(b) set removedOnCompletion to NO on animations so they are not automatically removed;
		(c) do not use layers associated with UIViews.
