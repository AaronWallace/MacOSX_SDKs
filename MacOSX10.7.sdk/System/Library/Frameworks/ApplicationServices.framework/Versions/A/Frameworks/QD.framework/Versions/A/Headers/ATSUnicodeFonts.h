 *  ATSUSetFontFeatures()   *** DEPRECATED ***

 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CTFontDescriptorCreateCopyWithFeature,
 *    CTFontDescriptorCreateWithAttributes instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Sets font features in a style object.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function enables you to set multiple font features for a
 *    style object. Any unset font features retain their font-defined
 *    default values. To set style attributes and font variations for a
 *    style object, call the functions ATSUSetAttributes and
 *    ATSUSetVariations, respectively. The constants that represent
 *    font feature types are defined in the header file
 *    SFNTLayoutTypes.h. When you use ATSUI to access and set font
 *    features, you must use the constants defined in this header file,
 *    which are described in "Inside Mac OS X: Rendering Unicode Text
 *    With ATSUI". As feature types can be added at any time, you
 *    should check Apple's font feature registry website for the most
 *    up-to-date list of font feature types and selectors:
 *    http://developer.apple.com/fonts/Registry/index.html.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iStyle:
 *      The style object for which to set font features.
 *    
 *    iFeatureCount:
 *      The number of font features to set. This value should
 *      correspond to the number of elements in the iType and iSelector
 *      arrays.
 *    
 *    iType:
 *      An array of feature types. Each element in the array must
 *      contain a valid feature type that corresponds to a feature
 *      selector in the iSelector array. To obtain the valid feature
 *      types for a font, call the function ATSUGetFontFeatureTypes .
 *    
 *    iSelector:
 *      An array of feature selectors. Each element in the array must
 *      contain a valid feature selector that corresponds to a feature
 *      type in the iType array. To obtain the valid feature selectors
 *      for a font, call the function ATSUGetFontFeatureSelectors .

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the font feature corresponding to an index into an array
 *    of font features for a style object.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    You might typically call ATSUGetFontFeature if you need to obtain
 *    one previously set feature after another within your program's
 *    processing loop. To obtain all previously set font features for a
 *    given style object, you can call the function
 *    ATSUGetAllFontFeatures. Before calling ATSUGetFontFeature, you
 *    should call the function ATSUGetAllFontFeatures to obtain a count
 *    of the font features that are set in the style object. You can
 *    then pass the index for the feature whose setting you want to
 *    obtain in the iTag and iMaximumValueSize parameters of
 *    ATSUGetFontFeature.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iStyle:
 *      The style you wish to obtain font feature information for.
 *    
 *    iFeatureIndex:
 *      An index into the array of font features for the style object.
 *      This index identifies the font feature to examine. Because this
 *      index is zero-based, you must pass a value between 0 and one
 *      less than the value produced in the oActualFeatureCount
 *      parameter of the function ATSUGetAllFontFeatures.
 *    
 *    oFeatureType:
 *      On return, the value identifies the font feature type
 *      corresponding to the index passed in the iFeatureIndex
 *      parameter. You must allocate space for ATSUGetFontFeature to
 *      store this value.
 *    
 *    oFeatureSelector:

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the font features of a style object that are not at
 *    default settings.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The ATSUGetAllFontFeatures function obtains all of a style
 *    object's font features that are not at default settings. Font
 *    features are grouped into categories called feature types, within
 *    which individual feature selectors define particular feature
 *    settings. The arrays produced by ATSUGetAllFontFeatures contain
 *    constants identifying the object's font types and their
 *    corresponding font selectors. Typically you use the function
 *    ATSUGetAllFontFeatures by calling it twice, as follows: (1) Pass
 *    a reference to the style object to examine in the iStyle
 *    parameter, a valid pointer to an ItemCount value in the
 *    oActualFeatureCount parameter, NULL for the oFeatureType and
 *    oFeatureSelector parameters, and 0 for the iMaximumFeatureCount
 *    parameter. ATSUGetAllFontFeatures returns the size in the
 *    oActualFeatureCount parameter to use for the feature type and
 *    selector arrays. (2) Allocate enough space for arrays of the
 *    returned size, then call ATSUGetAllFontFeatures again, passing a
 *    pointer to the arrays in the oFeatureType and oFeatureSelector
 *    parameters. On return, the arrays contain the font feature types
 *    and selectors, respectively, for the style object.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iStyle:
 *      The style for which you wish to obtain font feature information.
 *    
 *    iMaximumFeatureCount:
 *      The maximum number of feature types and selectors to obtain for
 *      the style object. Typically, this is equivalent to the number
 *      of ATSUFontFeatureType and ATSUFontFeatureSelector values for
 *      which you have allocated memory in the oFeatureType and
 *      oFeatureSelector parameters, respectively. To determine this
 *      value, see the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oFeatureType:
 *      On return, the array contains constants identifying each type
 *      of font feature that is at a nondefault setting in the style
 *      object. If you are uncertain of how much memory to allocate for
 *      this array, see the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oFeatureSelector:
 *      On return, the array contains constants identifying the feature
 *      selectors that are at nondefault settings in the style object.
 *      Each selector determines the setting for a corresponding

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function removes those font features that are identified by

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    If you supply font variation axes and values to the

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the number of ATSUI-compatible fonts installed on a
 *    user's system.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The ATSUFontCount function obtains the number of fonts on a
 *    user's system that are compatible with ATSUI. Incompatible fonts
 *    include those that cannot be used to represent Unicode, the
 *    missing-character glyph font, and fonts whose names begin with a
 *    period or a percent sign. You can use the count produced in the
 *    oFontCount parameter to determine the amount of memory to
 *    allocate for the oFontIDs array in the function ATSUGetFontIDs.
 *    It is important to note that the set of installed
 *    ATSUI-compatible fonts may change while your application is
 *    running. In Mac OS X, the set of installed fonts may change at
 *    any time. Although in Mac OS 9, fonts cannot be removed from the
 *    Fonts folder while an application other than the Finder is
 *    running, they can be removed from other locations, and it is
 *    possible for fonts to be added. Additionally, just because the
 *    number of fonts stays the same between two successive calls to
 *    ATSUFontCount , this does not mean that the font lists are the
 *    same. It is possible for a font to be added and another removed
 *    between two successive calls to ATSUFontCount , leaving the total
 *    number unchanged.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    oFontCount:
 *      On return, the number of ATSUI-compatible fonts installed on a
 *      user's system.
 *

 *    Typically you use the ATSUGetIndFontName function by calling it

 *    iFontNameIndex, and oActualNameLength parameters, 0 for the

 *    ATSUGetIndFontName returns the length of the font name string in

 *    passing a valid pointer to the buffer in the oName parameter. On
 *    return, the buffer contains the font name string. To find a name

 *    the function ATSUFindFontName. To obtain an ATSUI font ID for the
 *    first font in a name table that matches the specified name
 *    string, name code, platform, script, and/or language, call the
 *    function ATSUFindFontFromName.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iFontID:
 *      The font for which to obtain information. Note that because
 *      Apple Type Services assigns ATSUFontID values systemwide at
 *      runtime, font IDs can change across system restarts.
 *    
 *    iFontNameIndex:
 *      An index to the font for which to obtain information. Because
 *      this index must be 0-based, you should pass a value between 0
 *      and one less than the count produced by the function
 *      ATSUCountFontNames.
 *    
 *    iMaximumNameLength:
 *      The maximum length of the font name string to obtain.
 *      Typically, this is equivalent to the size of the buffer that
 *      you have allocated in the oName parameter. To determine this
 *      length, see the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oName:
 *      On return, the buffer contains the name string of the font

 *      passed. If the buffer you allocate is not large enough to
 *      contain the name string, ATSUGetIndFontName produces a partial

 *      parameter, see the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oActualNameLength:
 *      On return, the value specifies the actual length of the
 *      complete name string. This may be greater than the value passed
 *      in the iMaximumNameLength parameter. You should check this
 *      value to ensure that you have allocated sufficient memory and
 *      therefore obtained the complete name string for the font.
 *    
 *    oFontNameCode:
 *      On return, a value specifying the type of name returned (i.e.,

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the font variation axis values for a font instance.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    with a minimum value of 0.0, a default of 0.5, and a maximum of
 *    1.0. Additionally, the variation axis 'wdth' is also defined for
 *    the font, with a similar value range. The type designer can then
 *    choose to declare a font instance for a set of specific values
 *    within these axes, such as ÒDemiboldÓ for a value of 0.8 for the
 *    'wght' axis and 0.5 for the 'wdth' axis. By calling the function
 *    ATSUGetFontInstance , you can obtain the variation axis values
 *    for a given index into an array of font instances. Typically you
 *    use the function ATSUGetFontInstance by calling it twice, as
 *    follows: (1) Pass the ID of the font to examine in the iFont
 *    parameter, a valid pointer to an ItemCount value in the
 *    oActualVariationCount parameter, NULL for the oAxes and oValues
 *    parameters, and 0 for the other parameters. ATSUGetFontInstance
 *    returns the size to use for the oAxes and oValues arrays in the
 *    oActualVariationCount parameter. (2) Allocate enough space for
 *    arrays of the returned size, then call the ATSUGetFontInstance
 *    again, passing pointers to the arrays in the oAxes and oValues
 *    parameters. On return, the arrays contain the font variation axes
 *    and their corresponding values, respectively, for the font
 *    instance.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iFontID:
 *      The font for which to obtain instance information.
 *    
 *    iFontInstanceIndex:
 *      An index into an array of instances for the font. This index
 *      identifies the font instance to examine. Because this index is
 *      zero-based, you must pass a value between 0 and one less than
 *      the value produced in the oInstances parameter of the function
 *      ATSUCountFontInstances.
 *    
 *    iMaximumVariations:
 *      The maximum number of font variation axes to obtain for the
 *      font instance. Typically, this is equivalent to the number of
 *      ATSUFontVariationAxis and ATSUFontVariationValue values for
 *      which you have allocated memory in the oAxes and oValues
 *      parameters, respectively. To determine this value, see the
 *      Discussion.
 *    
 *    oAxes:
 *      On return, the array contains tags identifying the font
 *      variation axes that constitute the font instance. If you are
 *      uncertain of how much memory to allocate for this array, see
 *      the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oValues:
 *      On return, the array contains the defined values for the font
 *      variation axes produced in the oAxes array. If you are
 *      uncertain of how much memory to allocate for this array, see
 *      the Discussion.
 *    
 *    oActualVariationCount:
 *      On return, the actual number of font variation axes that
 *      constitute the font instance. This may be greater than the
 *      value you passed in the iMaximumVariations parameter.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    On success, noErr is returned. See MacErrors.h for possible error
 *    codes.
