 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Creates an ATSUStyle object with default settings.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    ATSUStyle objects created by this function have a default set of
 *    values for all attributes. The attributes include settings such
 *    as font, point size, color and so on. You can change the
 *    attributes of a style object by calling the function
 *    ATSUSetAttributes. You can also change font features and
 *    variations set in an ATSUStyle by calling the functions
 *    ATSUSetFontFeatures and ATSUSetVariations, respectively.
 *    ATSUStyle objects are used by associating them with a run of
 *    characters in an ATSUTextLayout object. You can do this by
 *    calling functions such as ATSUSetRunStyle or
 *    ATSUCreateTextLayoutWithTextPtr. You are responsible for freeing
 *    memory assoicated with an ATSUStyle object by calling
 *    ATSUDisposeStyle.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    oStyle:
 *      On return, a reference to an ATSUStyle object with default

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The ATSUCompareStyles function compares the contents of two style

 *  ATSUCalculateBaselineDeltas()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CoreText API instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Obtains the optimal baseline positions for glyphs in a style run.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Depending on the writing system, a baseline may be above, below,
 *    or through the centers of glyphs. In general, a style run has a
 *    default baseline, to which all glyphs are visually aligned when
 *    the text is laid out. For example, in a run of Roman text, the
 *    default baseline is the Roman baseline, upon which glyphs sit
 *    (except for descenders, which extend below the baseline). You can
 *    call the ATSUCalculateBaselineDeltas function to obtain the
 *    distances from a specified baseline type to that of other
 *    baseline types for a given style object.
 *    ATSUCalculateBaselineDeltas takes into account font and text size
 *    when performing these calculations. ATSUI uses these distances to
 *    determine the cross-stream shifting to apply when aligning glyphs
 *    in a style run. You can use the resulting array to set or obtain
 *    the optimal baseline positions of glyphs in a style run. You can
 *    also set various baseline values to create special effects such
 *    as drop capitals. The functions ATSUSetLineControls and
 *    ATSUSetLayoutControls allow you to set baseline offset values at
 *    the line or layout level, respectively, using the
 *    kATSULineBaselineValuesTag control attribute tag.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iStyle:
 *      An ATSUStyle value specifying the style object to examine.
 *    
 *    iBaselineClass:
 *      A BslnBaselineClass constant identifying the primary baseline
 *      from which to measure other baselines. See SFNTLayoutTypes.h
 *      for an enumeration of possible values. Pass the constant
 *      kBSLNNoBaselineOverride to use the standard baseline value from
 *      the current font.
 *

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Sets style attribute values in a style object.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Style attributes are a collection of values and settings that
 *    specify information about a style such as font, point size, and
 *    color. To specify a style attribute, ATSUI uses a "triple"
 *    consisting of (1) an attribute tag, (2) a value for that tag, and
 *    (3) the size of the value. For a list of possible tags and their
 *    default values, see the ATSUI documentation, or the definition of
 *    ATSUAttributeTag elsewhere in this header file. When you call
 *    ATSUSetAttributes, any style attributes that you do not set
 *    retain their previous values. To set font features and font
 *    variations, call the functions ATSUSetFontFeatures and
 *    ATSUSetVariations, respectively.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iStyle:
 *      A style in which to set attributes.
 *    
 *    iAttributeCount:
 *      An ItemCount value specifying the number of attributes to set.
 *      This value should correspond to the number of elements in the
 *      iTag, iValueSize, and iValue arrays.
 *    
 *    iTag:
 *      An array of attribute tags. The number of elements in this
 *      array must not be less than iAttributeCount. Each element in

 *      definition of ATSUAttributeTag for possible values).
 *    
 *    iValueSize:

 *    
 *    iValue:
 *      An array of pointers of type ATSUAttributeValuePtr. Each

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function returns information as to which attributes have had

 *    also return the size in bytes of the values of these attributes.
 *    Using this information, you can then call ATSUGetAttribute to

 *    function ATSUGetAllAttributes by calling it twice, as follows:
 *    (1) Pass a reference to the style object to examine in the iStyle
 *    parameter, a valid pointer to an ItemCount value in the
 *    oTagValuePairCount parameter, NULL for the oAttributeInfoArray
 *    parameter, and 0 for the iTagValuePairArraySize parameter.
 *    ATSUGetAllAttributes returns the size of the tag and value-size
 *    arrays in the oTagValuePairCount parameter. (2) Allocate enough
 *    space for an array of the returned size, then call the

 *  Summary:
 *    Creates an opaque text layout object containing default text
 *    layout attributes as well as associated text and text styles.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    This function creates a text layout object and associates the
 *    specified text buffer and style runs with it. All layout
 *    attributes are set to their default values. To provide nondefault
 *    line or layout attributes for a text layout object, you can call
 *    the functions ATSUSetLineControls or ATSUSetLayoutControls. After
 *    setting text attributes, call ATSUDrawText to draw the text.
 *    Because the only way that ATSUI interacts with text is via the
 *    memory references you associate with a text layout object, you
 *    are responsible for keeping these references updated through use
 *    of the functions ATSUTextInserted, ATSUTextDeleted,
 *    ATSUTextMoved, and ATSUSetTextPointerLocation. Note that, because
 *    ATSUI objects retain state information, doing superfluous calling
 *    can degrade performance. For example, you could call
 *    ATSUSetTextPointerLocation rather than ATSUTextInserted when the
 *    user inserts text, but there would be a performance penalty, as
 *    all the layout caches are flushed when you call
 *    ATSUSetTextPointerLocation , rather than just the affected ones.
 *    Text layout objects are readily reusable and should themselves be
 *    cached for later use, if possible. Text objects are thread-safe
 *    starting with ATSUI version 2.4.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iText:
 *      A text buffer containing UTF-16Ðencoded text. ATSUI associates
 *      this buffer with the new text layout object and analyzes the
 *      complete text of the buffer when obtaining the layout context
 *      for the current text range. Thus, for paragraph-format text, if
 *      you specify a buffer containing less than a complete paragraph,
 *      some of ATSUI's layout results are not guaranteed to be
 *      accurate. For example, with a buffer of less than a full
 *      paragraph, ATSUI can neither reliably obtain the context for
 *      bidirectional processing nor reliably generate accent
 *      attachments and ligature formations for Roman text.
 *    
 *    iTextOffset:
 *      The offset from the beginning of the text buffer to the first
 *      character of the range to include in the layout. To indicate
 *      that the specified text range starts at the beginning of the
 *      text buffer, you can pass the constant kATSUFromTextBeginning.
 *      To specify the entire text buffer, pass kATSUFromTextBeginning
 *      in this parameter and kATSUToTextEnd in the iTextLength
 *      parameter. For best results, use one layout for each paragraph
 *      within the text buffer.
 *    
 *    iTextLength:
 *      The length of the text range. Note that the sum of iTextOffset
 *      and iTextLength must be less than or equal to the value of the
 *      iTextTotalLength parameter. If you want the range of text to
 *      extend to the end of the text buffer, you can pass the constant
 *      kATSUToTextEnd. For best results, use one layout for each
 *      paragraph within the text buffer.
 *    
 *    iTextTotalLength:
 *      The length of the entire text buffer referred to by iText. This
 *      value should be greater than or equal to the range of text
 *      defined by the iTextLength parameter.
 *    
 *    iNumberOfRuns:
 *      The number of text style runs you want to define within the
 *      overall text range. The number of style objects and style run
 *      lengths passed in the iStyles and iRunLengths parameters,
 *      respectively, should be equal to the number of runs specified
 *      here.
 *    
 *    iRunLengths:
 *      An array providing ATSUI with the lengths of each of the text's
 *      style runs. You can pass kATSUToTextEnd for the last style run
 *      length if you want the style run to extend to the end of the
 *      text range. If the sum of the style run lengths is less than
 *      the total length of the text range, the remaining characters
 *      are assigned to the last style run.
 *    
 *    iStyles:
 *      An array of styles, each corresponding to a style run defined
 *      in iRunLengths. The same ATSUStyle object may be referred to
 *      more than once in this array. The number of elements in this
 *      array must be equal to the value specified by the iNumberOfRuns
 *      parameter.
 *    
 *    oTextLayout:
 *      A valid pointer to an ATSUTextLayout value. On return, the

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Clears the layout cache of a line or an entire text layout object.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    The layout cache contains all the layout information ATSUI
 *    calculates and needs to draw a range of text in a text layout
 *    object. This includes caret positions, the memory locations of
 *    glyphs, and other information needed to lay out the glyphs. ATSUI
 *    uses information in the layout cache to avoid laying out the text
 *    again, thereby improving performance. When you clear the layout
 *    cache of a line or block of text, ATSUI takes longer to redraw a
 *    line, since it must perform the calculations that support glyph
 *    layout again. You should call the function ATSUClearLayoutCache
 *    when you need to decrease the amount of memory your application
 *    uses. This function reclaims memory at the cost of optimal
 *    performance. By default, the ATSUClearLayoutCache function
 *    removes the layout cache of a single line. To clear the layout
 *    cache for multiple lines, you should call ATSUClearLayoutCache
 *    for each line. To clear the layout cache of an entire text layout
 *    object, pass the constant kATSUFromTextBeginning in the
 *    iLineStart parameter. Note that ATSUClearLayoutCache does not
 *    produce a function error if lines do not have a layout cache. The
 *    ATSUClearLayoutCache function flushes the layout cache but does
 *    not alter previously set text layout attributes, soft line break
 *    positions, or the text memory location. If you do not want to
 *    retain these values, you should dispose of the text layout object
 *    by calling the ATSUDisposeTextLayout function.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout for which to clear the layout caches.
 *    
 *    iLineStart:
 *      The offset from the beginning of the text buffer to the
 *      beginning of the line for which to discard the layout cache. If
 *      the range of text spans multiple lines, you should call
 *      ATSUClearLayoutCache for each line, passing the offset
 *      corresponding to the beginning of the new line to draw with
 *      each call. To clear the layout cache of the entire text layout
 *      object, you can pass the constant kATSUFromTextBeginning.

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Associates a text buffer with a text layout object or updates
 *    previously associated text.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    For ATSUI to render your text, you must associate the text with
 *    both a text layout object and style information. Some functions,
 *    such as ATSUCreateTextLayoutWithTextPtr, create a text layout
 *    object and associate text with it concurrently. However, if you
 *    use the function ATSUCreateTextLayout to create a text layout
 *    object, you must assign text to the object prior to attempting
 *    most ATSUI operations. You can use the function
 *    ATSUSetTextPointerLocation to associate text with a layout
 *    object. When you call this function, you are both assigning a
 *    text buffer to a text layout object and specifying the current
 *    text subrange within the buffer to include in the layout. If
 *    there is already text associated with a text layout object,
 *    calling ATSUSetTextPointerLocation overrides the previously
 *    associated text, as well as clearing the object's layout caches.
 *    You would typically only call this function for a text layout
 *    object with existing associated text if either (a) both the
 *    buffer itself is relocated and a subrange of the buffer's text is
 *    deleted or inserted or (b) when associating an entirely different
 *    buffer with a text layout object. Note that, because ATSUI
 *    objects retain state, doing superfluous calling can degrade
 *    performance. For example, you could call
 *    ATSUSetTextPointerLocation rather than ATSUTextInserted when the
 *    user simply inserts a subrange of text within a text buffer, but
 *    there would be a performance penalty, as all the layout caches
 *    are flushed by ATSUSetTextPointerLocation, rather than just the
 *    affected ones. Similarly, you should not call
 *    ATSUSetTextPointerLocation, when an entire text buffer associated
 *    with a text layout object is relocated, but no other changes have
 *    occurred that would affect the buffer's current subrange.
 *    Instead, you should call ATSUTextMoved, which is a more focused
 *    function and therefore more efficient. After associating text
 *    with a text layout object, use ATSUSetRunStyle to associate style
 *    information with the text. You can then call the function
 *    ATSUDrawText to display the text or a subrange of the text.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout object for which you wish to associate a text buffer.
 *    
 *    iText:
 *      A pointer to a buffer of Unicode text in UTF-16 format. This is
 *      the text that will be associated with iTextLayout.
 *    
 *    iTextOffset:
 *      The starting offset of the subrange of the text buffer you wish
 *      to associate with iTextLayout. To indicate that the specified
 *      text range starts at the beginning of the text buffer, you can
 *      pass the constant kATSUFromTextBeginning . To specify the
 *      entire text buffer, pass kATSUFromTextBeginning in this
 *      parameter and kATSUToTextEnd in the iTextLength parameter.
 *    
 *    iTextLength:
 *      The length of the subrage of the text buffer you wish to
 *      associate with iTextLayout. Note that the sum of iTextOffset
 *      and iTextLength must be less than or equal to the value of the
 *      iTextTotalLength parameter. If you want the range of text to
 *      extend to the end of the text buffer, you can pass the constant
 *      kATSUToTextEnd.
 *    
 *    iTextTotalLength:
 *      The length of the entire text buffer. This value should be
 *      greater than or equal to the range of text defined by the

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    When you use ATSUI to image your text, you can control the text's

 *    line, and run. The level affected by this function is the layout
 *    level, which is that of the entire text range associated with

 *    the text, its justification, rotation, and direction, as well as
 *    other layout options. See ATSUSetLineControls for information
 *    about controling text and the line level. Similar to style
 *    attributes, you use a "triple" to specify a line or layout
 *    control attribute. That is, (1) an attribute tag, (2) the size
 *    (in bytes) of the attribute value, and (3) the value of the
 *    attribute it sets. Attribute tags are constants supplied by

 *    pointer. And as with style attributes, you can also create a
 *    custom attribute for a line or layout attribute for which ATSUI
 *    does not provide a tag. For a list of layout control tags defined
 *    by ATSUI and their default values, see the definition of
 *    ATSUAttributeTag.
 *

 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The text layout in which to set layout-level controls.
 *    
 *    iAttributeCount:
 *      The number of attributes to set. This value should correspond

 *  
 *  Summary:

 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    Before calling ATSUGetLayoutControl, you should call the function

 *    use the function ATSUGetLayoutControl by calling it twice, as
 *    follows: (1) Pass a reference to the text layout object to
 *    examine in the iTextLayout parameter, NULL for the oValue
 *    parameter, 0 for the iExpectedValueSize parameter.
 *    ATSUGetLayoutControl returns the actual size of the attribute

 *    attribute value contained in the text layout object. For a list
 *    of layout control tags defined by ATSUI and their default values,
 *    see the definition of ATSUAttributeTag.
 *

 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Sets one or more line control values for a specified line in a
 *    text layout.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    When you use ATSUI to image your text, you can control the text's
 *    display and formatting at a number of different levels: layout,
 *    line, and run. The level affected by this function is the line
 *    level. These attributes are similar to those that you can apply
 *    on a full-layout basis, but each affects only an individual text
 *    line. Note that setting line control attributes overrides the
 *    corresponding layout-level settings. Also, from a performance
 *    standpoint, it is preferable to work from the layout level and
 *    not specify such controls line by line unless necessary. Lines
 *    are determined by soft breaks that may be set in your layout. You
 *    can specify a line by giving a starting offset into the text
 *    buffer. Attributes at this level affect the width of the text
 *    area from margin to margin, the alignment of the text, its
 *    justification, rotation, and direction, as well as other layout
 *    options. Similar to style attributes, you use a "triple" to
 *    specify a line or layout control attribute. That is, (1) an
 *    attribute tag, (2) the size (in bytes) of the attribute value,
 *    and (3) the value of the attribute it sets. Attribute tags are
 *    constants supplied by ATSUI. Attribute values may be a scalar, a
 *    structure, or a pointer. And as with style attributes, you can
 *    also create a custom attribute for a line or layout attribute for
 *    which ATSUI does not provide a tag. For a list of line control
 *    tags defined by ATSUI and their default values, see the
 *    definition of ATSUAttributeTag.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout in which you wish to set line controls.
 *    
 *    iLineStart:
 *      The starting offset of the line for which you wish to set
 *      controls.
 *    
 *    iAttributeCount:
 *      The number of attributes to set. This value should correspond
 *      to the number of elements in the iTag, iValueSize, and iValue
 *      arrays.
 *    
 *    iTag:
 *      An array of attribute tags to set. For a list of line control
 *      tags defined by ATSUI and their default values, see the
 *      definition of ATSUAttributeTag.

 *  ATSUSetRunStyle()   *** DEPRECATED ***
 *  
 *  Deprecated:
 *    Use CoreText API and CFAttributedStringSetAttributes instead.
 *  
 *  Summary:
 *    Defines a style run by associating style information with a run
 *    of text.
 *  
 *  Discussion:
 *    A text run consists of one or more characters that are contiguous
 *    in memory. If you associate these characters with a distinct
 *    style, you define a style run. You can use the ATSUSetRunStyle
 *    function to define a style run, by associating a style object
 *    with a run of text in a text layout object. Each text run must be
 *    assigned a style object, which may or may not differ from other
 *    style objects assigned to other text runs in a given text layout
 *    object. After calling ATSUSetRunStyle, you can call the function
 *    ATSUDrawText to display the styled text. When you call
 *    ATSUDrawText, if you have not previously assigned styles to all
 *    the characters you request to be drawn, ATSUI automatically does
 *    so. Specifically, ATSUI extends the first style it locates
 *    immediately prior (in storage order) to the unstyled characters
 *    to include those unassigned characters. If the unstyled
 *    characters are at the beginning of the text stream, ATSUI finds
 *    the first style run in the stream and extends it backward to the
 *    first character. You should call ATSUSetRunStyle whenever you
 *    create a new text layout object without any associated styles, as
 *    by using the function ATSUCreateTextLayout. You should also call
 *    ATSUSetRunStyle to assign a style to a text run in response to a
 *    user action, such as when the user selects a run of text and
 *    changes the font. You do not need to call ATSUSetRunStyle when
 *    you change style attributes or text layout attributes. In such
 *    cases, ATSUI automatically updates the layout of the text as
 *    appropriate.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The layout in which you wish to set the style run.
 *    
 *    iStyle:
 *      The style to be assigned to the run of characters.
 *    
 *    iRunStart:
 *      The start of the run of characters. To specify the beginning of
 *      the text buffer, pass kATSUFromTextBeginning for this parameter.
 *    
 *    iRunLength:
 *      The end of the run of characters. To specify a run that
 *      continues to the end of the text buffer, pass kATSUToTextEnd
 *      for this parameter.

 *    scanning the fonts in the user's system. ATSUI first searches in
 *    the standard application fonts for various languages. If that
 *    fails, ATSUI searches through the remaining fonts on the system
 *    in the order in which the Font Manager returns the fonts. After
 *    ATSUI has searched all the fonts in the system, any unmatched
 *    text is drawn using the last-resort font. That is, missing glyphs
 *    are represented by and empty box to indicate to the user that a
 *    valid font for that character is not installed on their system.
 *    You can alter ATSUI's default search behavior by calling the
 *    function ATSUCreateFontFallbacks and defining your own font
 *    fallback settings for the text layout object. Because ATSUI does
 *    not necessarily completely scan the text range you specify with
 *    each call to ATSUMatchFontsToText, if ATSUI does find any
 *    characters that cannot be rendered with their current font, you
 *    should call ATSUMatchFontsToText again and update the input range
 *    to check that all the subsequent characters in the range can be
 *    drawn. For that reason, you should call ATSUMatchFontsToText from
 *    within a loop to assure that the entire range of text is checked.
 *    Note that calling ATSUMatchFontsToText does not cause the
 *    suggested font substitution to be performed. If you want ATSUI to
 *    perform font substitution automatically, you can call the
 *    function ATSUSetTransientFontMatching.
 *  
 *  Parameters:
 *    
 *    iTextLayout:
 *      The text layout object to examine.
 *    
 *    iTextStart:
 *      The first character of the range to examine. To start at the
 *      beginning of the text buffer, pass the constant
 *      kATSUFromTextBeginning.
 *    
 *    iTextLength:
 *      The length of the text range to examine. If you want the range
 *      of text to extend to the end of the text buffer, you can pass
 *      the constant kATSUToTextEnd.
 *    
 *    oFontID:
 *      On return, the value provides a font ID for the suggested
 *      substitute font or kATSUInvalidFontID, if no substitute font is
 *      available.
 *    
 *    oChangedOffset:
 *      On return, this value specifies the offset from the beginning
 *      of the text buffer to the first character that cannot be drawn
 *      with the current font.
 *    
 *    oChangedLength:
 *      On return, this value specifies the length of the text range
 *      that cannot be drawn with the current font.
 *  
 *  Result:
 *    The result code noErr indicates that all the characters in the
 *    given range can be rendered with their current font(s) and no
 *    font substitution is needed. If you receive either of the result
 *    codes kATSUFontsMatched or kATSUFontsNotMatched, you should
 *    update the input range and call ATSUMatchFontsToText again to
 *    ensure that all the characters in the range can be drawn. See
 *    MacErrors.h for other possible error codes.
