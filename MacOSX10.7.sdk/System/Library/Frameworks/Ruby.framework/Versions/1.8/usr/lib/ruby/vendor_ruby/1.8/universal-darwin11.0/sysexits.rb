#
# Preferred exit codes for programs
#
# == Description
#
# Error numbers begin at EX__BASE to reduce the possibility of
# clashing with other exit statuses that random programs may
# already return.  The meaning of the codes is approximately
# as follows:
#
# +EX_USAGE+:: The command was used incorrectly, e.g., with the wrong number of
#              arguments, a bad flag, a bad syntax in a parameter, or whatever.
# +EX_DATAERR+:: The input data was incorrect in some way.
#                This should only be used for user's data & not system files.
# +EX_NOINPUT+:: An input file (not a system file) did not
#                exist or was not readable.  This could also include
#                errors like "No message" to a mailer (if it cared
#                to catch it).
# +EX_NOUSER+:: The user specified did not exist.  This might
#               be used for mail addresses or remote logins.
# +EX_NOHOST+:: The host specified did not exist.  This is used
#               in mail addresses or network requests.
# +EX_UNAVAILABLE+:: A service is unavailable.  This can occur
#                    if a support program or file does not exist.  This
#                    can also be used as a catchall message when something
#                    you wanted to do doesn't work, but you don't know why.
# +EX_SOFTWARE+:: An internal software error has been detected.
#                 This should be limited to non-operating system related
#                 errors as possible.
# +EX_OSERR+:: An operating system error has been detected.
#              This is intended to be used for such things as "cannot
#              fork", "cannot create pipe", or the like.  It includes
#              things like getuid returning a user that does not
#              exist in the passwd file.
# +EX_OSFILE+:: Some system file (e.g., /etc/passwd, /etc/utmp,
#               etc.) does not exist, cannot be opened, or has some
#               sort of error (e.g., syntax error).
# +EX_CANTCREAT+:: A (user specified) output file cannot be created.
# +EX_IOERR+:: An error occurred while doing I/O on some file.
# +EX_TEMPFAIL+:: Temporary failure, indicating something that
#                 is not really an error.  In sendmail, this means
#                 that a mailer (e.g.) could not create a connection,
#                 and the request should be reattempted later.
# +EX_PROTOCOL+:: The remote system returned something that
#                 was "not possible" during a protocol exchange.
# +EX_NOPERM+:: You did not have sufficient permission to
#               perform the operation.  This is not intended for
#               file system problems, which should use NOINPUT or
#               CANTCREAT, but rather for higher level permissions.
